The man was filmed by a fellow passenger calling the elderly woman an ""ugly black bastard"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow"".

The footage was recorded on October 19 on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted by UK resident David Lawrence who uploaded it on to social media.

It shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He replies: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

The man then calls her ""an ugly f****** c***"" and tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: ""if you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat"".

Ryanair has been criticised for failing to throw a passenger off a flight (Niall Carson/PA)

Staff on the flight seemed to do little to silence the man during the footage, leaving a passenger in the row behind to try and deal with the situation.

The cabin crew can be heard to say: ""Don't be so rude, you have to calm down"" while other passengers call for the man to be thrown off the flight.

The victim can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash, before asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter.

The daughter of the woman who was targeted said she believed if a black person had behaved in the same way they would have been thrown off the flight immediately.

The woman, 53, told the Huffington Post the row had started because her 77-year-old mother's arthritis meant it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

The daughter said she had taken her mother, who is a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark one year since the death of her father.

""My parents were married over 50 years. She's been feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her spirits.""

She continued: ""I know that if I was behaving like he was or any other black person for that matter, police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight.""

""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing. As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with,"" she said.

The woman said that when she had complained to cabin crew they denied hearing any racial slurs and they told her to ring customer services on Monday.

News of the incident was retweeted 18,000 times after a user with the handle @StanceGrounded uploaded Mr Laurence's clip, prompting widespread condemnation of Ryanair for failing to act swiftly.

A number of politicians voiced their concern at Ryanair's apparent lack of action.

Labour MP for East Hull and shadow Attorney General Karl Turner tweeted: ""He should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police.

""We assume the aircraft was in the UK. If it was he definitely committed criminal offences. I fully expect @Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight.""

MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: ""This is really appalling @Ryanair . You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.""

Fellow MSP politician Margaret Ferrier said: ""Just watched the shocking footage on a @Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed.

""Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately. However well done to passenger with black t-shirt that intervened #hero.""

The budget airline tweeted on Sunday that it had seen the footage and reported the incident to Essex police.

It added: ""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""",news,2018-10-21,2018-10-21T11:30:00Z,eng-4364609,0.0,eng,0.7764706015586853,11:30:00,Ryanair criticised for failing to remove racist passenger from flight,974809442,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-6299829/Ryanair-criticised-failing-remove-racist-passenger-flight.html,dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,13,David,0

DUBLIN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Ryanair said on Monday it hopes to conclude its remaining labour issues by Christmas, signalling a possible end to damaging flight disruptions which have dragged on its shares.

The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, also said it may have to cut its capacity further this winter due to high oil costs and intense competition, although these factors were helping it to resolve its difficult industrial relations.

""Given the adverse environment that's out there for airlines and the number of job losses being reported in recent weeks both by pilots and cabin crew, there is a much more sensible, common sense approach being taken by the unions,"" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation.

Ryanair shares rose by 3.7 percent at 0755 GMT, despite it reporting a 7 percent fall in profit during its key April-September season due to high fuel costs, excess capacity and damage to bookings caused by a wave of strikes.

That was better than the 9 percent fall forecast by a poll of analysts in the wake of an Oct. 1 profit warning.

Over-capacity is likely to continue to weigh on average fares in the winter unless there is a major failure of a rival, but the failure of several small airlines in recent weeks is concentrating the minds of staff, O'Leary said.

Ryanair only needs to secure agreement with two major unions, in Belgium and Germany and is ""hopeful of concluding agreements with them this side of Christmas"", he added.

The airline, which has in the past threatened cuts to growth during negotiations with unions, has struggled with labour relations since it bowed to pressure to recognise trade unions for the first time last December.

Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent three weeks ago and warned that worse may follow if a recent wave of pilot and cabin crew strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.

OIL IMPACT

Increases in the oil price or further falls in fares could force Ryanair to add to the 1 percent cut in capacity announced alongside a profit warning on Oct. 1.

""If oil remains at or above $85 a barrel and fares are under pressure then it would probably be the sensible thing to do to take a look at capacity,"" Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorohan said.

Ryanair, which makes most of its profit in the summer, reported a profit of 1.2 billion euros ($1.38 billion) in the six months to Sept. 30. It reiterated its full-year profit forecast of between 1.1 billion euros and 1.2 billion euros.

That would be a 17-24 percent fall from the record 1.45 billion euro post-tax profit in its most recent financial year.

A poll of more than 10 analysts by Ryanair before the results found an average forecast of 1.127 billion euros for the full year and 1.175 billion for the six months to Sept. 30.

2,[],"Ryanair made almost £1.8billion last year through the sale of add-ons

No-frills airline Ryanair is changing its baggage rules from next month, demanding customers pay £6 for priority boarding if they want to take a 10kg bag on board on top of hand luggage that fits under a seat.

Budget carrier Wizz Air is also ramping up charges at the same time. It is asking passengers to pay up to €15 (£13) for priority boarding if they wish to take a 10kg carry-on case in addition to a small free bag measuring 40cm x 30cm x 20cm.

Previously both airlines often allowed small carry-on cases weighing up to 10kg to be taken on board for free.

Lucrative: Ryanair made almost £1.8billion last year through the sale of add-ons

These additional charges represent the latest bid by airlines to boost their so-called 'ancillary revenue' - comprising charges from extras.

The lucrative ruses include charging a fee just for booking and demanding money if you check in at the airport instead of online in advance.

If you want to pick a reserved seat to avoid a scrum when boarding you will have to pay and there is another charge for putting luggage in the hold.

Ryanair made almost £1.8billion last year through the sale of add-ons. This accounted for 28 per cent of its revenue. But research indicates that the equivalent percentage for Wizz Air was 42 per cent.

EasyJet generated £1 billion from ancillary services - 19 per cent of total revenue - while at British Airways add-ons represented only 5 per cent of total revenue.

How my £9.78 flight ended up at £65.99

Wanting to escape the UK for a few days, I decided to cheer myself up by tapping in 'cheap flight Spain' into an internet search engine, writes Toby Walne.

On the home page 'Cheap Flights to Spain from £9.78 - Ryanair' is the top option. Press on the link and the cost immediately rises by 21p but the deal still looks too good to be true. Can the extras really add up to more than the ticket price? For a good seat with legroom, jumping the queues and taking a 10kg hand bag on board while packing a suitcase I soon end up paying more than five times the initial price - and that is just one way.

Even when I try to opt for the cheapest seats pop-up windows warn me to 'avoid the middle seat' and 'don't risk random allocation' offering 25 per cent discounts for opting to pay extra for the journey.

I must also battle my way through 'car hire sale' and 'exclusive deals on hotels' promotions - designed to get me to part with even more money - before the airline allows me to simply book the flight I want.

Jay Sorensen, company president of market researcher IdeaWorksCompany, says: 'Low-cost carriers are fighting for market share - and they are doing this through deep price discounting. They then boost their income through applying lucrative add-ons.'

He adds: 'Baggage and seat assignment fees are key areas that airlines focus on. We expect low-cost carriers to try to win more business travellers in the future with service bundle deals, which may include extra upgrades such as for priority boarding.'

The trick for travellers is to plan ahead and not be choosy about who they sit next to. Among the extra charges by airlines such as Ryanair are at least £15 for extra legroom, between £4 and £13 for an allocated seat and £20 for printing a boarding pass at the airport. The cost of priority boarding ahead of other passengers starts from £6 but people often pay more.

Baggage fees for budget airlines remain the biggest earner so pack light and always book online. Ryanair demands at least £25 to check in a 20kg suitcase online but if you wait until you get to the airport it is £40. Go over the baggage limit and it will cost £10 per extra kilogram.

EasyJet charges between £13.99 and £33.99 - depending on the flight - for a suitcase weighing up to 23kg, but if it weighs up to 15kg it is between £8.99 and £29.99.

Wizz Air charges between £13 and £65 for a 20kg bag depending on the route. Exceed this and there is a £9.50-a-kilogram excess baggage fee. As with other airlines, if you fail to book online, the cost of checking in luggage is higher - at least £56.

If you are taking lots of heavy bags you will be better off using a courier service - which picks up your bags from home and drops them at your hotel. A service such as Send My Bag can send 30kg of luggage to Spain for £32 within three to four days. You could pay £125 for taking the bags on Ryanair.

Wizz Air charges between £13 and £65 for a 20kg bag depending on the route

Airlines can no longer charge for payment of a flight using a credit card but some, such as easyJet, still hit passengers with a £16 'administration fee.' Double check everything when you book - and do it all online - to avoid crippling charges for making a mistake or being penalised at check-in.

For example, changing a name online with Ryanair is £115 - or £160 at the airport. Check-in is free online but £55 at the airport. Lose your boarding pass on the way to the gate and it is a further £20.

Despite fees, the number of people opting for allocated seats has doubled. This is because the random allocation of seats means partners are sometimes sat away from each other. The number of customers paying for priority boarding has also risen fourfold for Ryanair as people attempt to avoid a scrum at the departure gate.

Hannah Maundrell, of consumer website Money, says: 'Budget airlines are great if travelling light, but if you have luggage, want a decent seat and a free glass of wine, you are better off looking elsewhere.' She adds: 'Assume an airline will always try to generate more money through sneaky charges. Seat allocation is a naughty extra but if you pack less you will make the most savings from using a budget airline.'

Ryanair says: 'Over the past 18 months we have seen about half our customers reserve a seat. All optional extras are visible and transparent on our website. All fees are brought to customers' attention and agreed prior to boarding.'

3,[],"This has pushed up average amount paid in extras per passenger to around £15

Ryanair is squeezing more than £6million a day in extra charges from passengers, it emerged yesterday.

A surge in the number of people paying extra just to reserve a seat or bring a second bag on board has enabled the budget airline to generate £1.15billion from add-ons in just six months.

In results posted yesterday, the Irish-based carrier revealed the amount it generated from 'ancillary sales' soared by 27 per cent.

Ryanair is squeezing more than £6million a day in extra charges from passengers. Stock picture of a Ryanair aeroplane

It includes everything apart from the fare and baggage fee - ranging from priority boarding to seats with extra legroom, snacks and sandwiches and car hire.

This has pushed up the average amount paid in extras per passenger to around £15.

Ryanair blamed strikes by cabin crew, pilots and air traffic controllers, as well as higher fuel costs, for dragging down its profit by 7 per cent to £1.06billion. A controversial crackdown in January meant passengers had to pay between £6 and £8 for priority boarding if they wanted to take a second, larger bag - such as a wheelie suitcase - on board the plane.

Ryanair insisted it was purely to cut down on delays caused by passengers bringing on more luggage than could fit in the overhead lockers. The airline also doubled the cost of seat reservation charges earlier this year while hiking the cost of extra legroom seats.

Seat reservation fees increased from £2 to £4 per passenger for one journey - or £8 for a return trip. Reserving a seat with extra legroom rose from £11 to £15 per journey. Parents with children under 12 have to pay £6 to guarantee they can sit with them.

The Civil Aviation Authority has been investigating the price of tickets and 'add-on charges' including booking and baggage fees.

One of the main focuses of the probe will be allegations some airlines are deliberately splitting families up unless they pay to reserve seats. The watchdog estimates this tactic is costing passengers up to £400million a year in fees.

Its initial findings show that on Ryanair more than one in three families are separated. The airline has strongly denied accusations it deliberately splits up families and says it allocates seats on a random basis.

But Guy Anker, managing editor at Moneysavingexpert, said: 'It is appalling if this is a deliberate tactic.' He added: 'These charges are not hidden, but they're still sneaky.'

A Ryanair spokesman said: 'Customers may choose to purchase additional products and services, the prices for which are fully transparent and displayed throughout the booking process.'",news,2018-10-22,2018-10-22T23:05:00Z,eng-4364609,0.0,eng,0.3960784375667572,23:05:00,Ryanair generates whopping £1.5billion in just six months from add-ons,975981521,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6304923/Ryanair-generates-whopping-1-5billion-just-six-months-add-ons.html,dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,13,Myriam,0

Ryanair came under intense pressure today after refusing to kick off a passenger who launched a torrent of racist abuse at a 77-year-old pensioner sitting beside him.

The man - who has not been arrested - was filmed unleashing a highly-offensive tirade against the Windrush immigrant on a flight from Barcelona to London.

In the video, the unidentified white man can be heard calling the woman an 'ugly black b******' while threatening to push her off the row of seats they shared.

Social media users condemned the lack of action taken against the man, with MPs Chris Grayling and David Lammy among those urging police to take action.

And shadow transport minister Labour MP Karl Turner claimed the passenger may 'get away with it' due to the airline wanting to get the plane off the ground.

The incident happened in Barcelona on Friday afternoon, before the video was posted on Saturday. But Essex Police only learned yesterday about what happened.

The man (wearing glasses left and right) unleashed a torrent of racist abuse at the elderly woman sitting one seat away from him on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London Stansted

Despite repeatedly abusing the woman, Ryanair staff initially appeared to watch the argument unfold without intervening and refused to kick the man off the plane.

The victim's family added to pressure by saying Ryanair staff claimed to have heard no racist language being used in the exchange while brushing off their complaints.

The video has sparked a huge backlash, with MP David Lammy even likening the victim's ordeal to that of American civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks.

The incident unfolded on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted Airport last Friday as the victim returned from a family getaway.

Among those angered on social media was George Kaimakis, who tweeted: 'It's shameful that Ryanair allowed this racist to get away with his abuses - he should have been escorted off the plane, under police arrest if necessary.'

Imogen Dempsey added: 'I don't understand why on earth Ryanair didn't either remove him and abandon him in Spain, or have the police waiting for him at Stansted? Hope the police arrest him pronto and the CPS actually prosecute.'

And Nicole Le Bold said: 'More people should have intervened. One man on a plane filled with passengers intervened... one man!

'That vile racist should have had a citizen's arrest until the police arrived and been ejected off the flight, given that Ryanair staff failed to act'

What are hate crimes and hate incidents?

An act is considered a hate incident if the victim or anyone else thinks it was motivated by hostility or prejudice based on disability, race, religion, transgender identity or sexual orientation.

Some police forces also record hate incidents based on other personal characteristics such as age or alternative sub-cultures, such as goths, emos or punks.

The incidents can include verbal abuse like name-calling and offensive jokes; harassment; bullying or intimidation by children, adults, neighbours or strangers; physical attacks such as hitting, punching, pushing or spitting; threats of violence; hoax calls, abusive phone or text messages, hate mail; online abuse, for example on Facebook or Twitter; displaying or circulating discriminatory literature or posters; harm or damage to things such as your home, pet or vehicle; graffiti; arson; throwing rubbish into a garden; and malicious complaints, for example over parking, smells or noise.

When hate incidents are considered criminal offences they become hate crimes - and are classed under Criminal Justice Act 2003.

Incidents which are based on other personal characteristics, such as age and belonging to an alternative subculture, are not considered to be hate crimes under the law.

Another social media user called 'Dave' added: 'Police should've been there to arrest him as soon as the plane disembarked. Shouldn't be up to a customer and social media to get it dealt with.'

A further Twitter user said: 'The correct action was to move the lady for her own safety and have Spanish police arrest the man for air piracy. But no they took off with an aggressive violent passenger, putting the flight at risk. Well done Ryanair.'

And one commenter tweeted: 'Police, do your job and arrest him. Enough evidence for conviction. Judges don't go soft with sentencing. Ryanair.'

The woman, who moved to the UK in the 1960s and has been identified only as Mrs Gayle, was taken on the trip to lift her spirits on the one-year anniversary of her husband.

Speaking last night, she told ITV: 'I am so depressed. I've just lost my husband and now I have to go through this.'

Her daughter said that the tirade began before take-off when the man complained that her mother was taking too long to move from her aisle seat as he tried to access a window seat.

A verbal argument ensued between the man and Mrs Gayle's daughter, who angrily asked him to have patience because her arthritis-suffering mother is disabled.

During the exchange, the man replies: 'I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.'

The man also called Mrs Gayle 'an ugly f****** c***' and tells staff to move the woman to another seat.

When the elderly passenger addresses the man herself in a Jamaican accent, he responds: 'Don't talk to me in a f***ing foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow.'

As cabin crew appeared to do little to stop the melee, a fellow passenger in the row behind tells the man to stop and puts his hands between the two passengers.

But the abuser responds: 'I will carry on as long as I can with this black b******.'

The man repeatedly demands that the woman should move seat, at one stage adding: 'If you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat.'

Do you know the man? Were you on board? Email: mark.duell@mailonline.co.uk

At one stage, Mrs Gayle herself asks to be moved and can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash.

The man says: 'If you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat.'

A flight attendant eventually addresses the man, saying: 'Don't be so rude, you have to calm down.'

The victim's daughter, 53, last night said that the family would never fly with Ryanair again over its handling of the incident.

Other passengers tried to help the woman before a flight attendant stepped in on the flight

The woman (left) was eventually moved from her seat leaving the man alone in the row (right)

She told the Huffington Post: 'In a few weeks, it'll be one year since my dad died and I took my mum away for a few days' break. My parents were married for over 50 years.

'She's been feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her spirits.'

Speaking anonymously, she said that the incident would have been handled differently if the abuser had been black.

Ryanair profits knocked by higher fuel costs and strikes

Ryanair has reported a dip in half year profits after the budget airline was stung by higher fuel costs and compensation payouts linked to flight delays and cancellations.

The Irish carrier booked a 9 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to €1.3billion in the six months to September 30.

Ryanair, which was forced to issue a profit warning earlier this month, said higher fuel and staff and compensation costs offset strong revenue growth, which rose 8 per cent to €4.79billion.

The budget airline added that average fares declined 3 per cent due to excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, and repeated strikes and staff shortages which caused a spike in cancellations of higher fare, weekend flights.

Ryanair has also been stung by pilot and cabin crew strikes, knocking passenger numbers and resulting in hefty compensation costs.

It has also hit customer confidence in the company, with passengers making fewer forward bookings into the third quarter including for the October school half-term and Christmas.

That was on top of rising oil prices, which have bumped up Ryanair's fuel bill by 22 per cent to €1.3billion.

Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'As recently guided, first half average fares fell by 3 per cent. While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27 per cent, these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 (compensation) costs.

'Our traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC (air traffic control) disruptions on record, grew 6 per cent at an unchanged 96 per cent load factor.'

'We have trimmed winter capacity by 1 per cent (including base closures in Eindhoven and Bremen) in response to weaker fares and higher oil prices.'

Looking ahead, Ryanair said it now expects annual traffic growth of 6 per cent to 138 million passengers - slightly down on previous guidance of 139 million - following a 1 per cent reduction in winter capacity.

The airline's fuel bill is expected to come in about €460million higher year-on-year.

Ryanair said that its profit guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further, and the absence of unforeseen strikes and negative Brexit developments.

'The risk of a hard ('no-deal') Brexit in March 2019 is rising. While we hope that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), we remain concerned that the time to complete such an agreement is shortening,' Mr O'Leary added.

'My mother has worked her all of her life, paid her taxes and her dues,' her daughter added. 'Why should she have to go through all of this?

'Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief that she's already experiencing.

'As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with. We will never fly with Ryanair again.'

Passenger David Lawrence, whose video of the incident has been viewed almost three million times, said: 'He should have been ejected off the flight but instead he started to suggest that the woman move.'

'They (Ryanair) took too long to respond to this. The film was posted two days and it is only now that they are responding, which is absolutely unacceptable. It was so unprofessional.'

He also told the Huffington Post: 'I spoke to the pilot at the end of the flight. He suggested that we make a formal complaint to Ryanair.'

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What we saw was totally unacceptable.

'The fact is that abuse of that kind, racial abuse of that kind, is a crime - and, if a crime is committed, it should be dealt with appropriately.

'And so therefore I would hope that, notwithstanding what took place on that day, police would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case.'

Labour MP Mr Turner led the backlash. He wrote online: 'Ryanair have failed spectacularly here. Suspect the pressure to turn this aircraft around quickly and get it airborne meant that they have allowed this alleged offender to remain on the aircraft. He may now get away with it.'

He added: 'I shall be writing to Ryanair and the Aviation Minister Liz Sugg to ask what they've done about this.

'Clearly committed criminal offences. Racially Aggravated s.39 and or racially Aggravated s.5 Public Order. Needs to be charged and fast.'

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What we saw was totally unacceptable.

'And so therefore I would hope that, notwithstanding what took place on that day, police would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case.'

And MP David Lammy even likened the victim's ordeal to American civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks.

He said: 'Boycott Ryanair. If they think it's OK for a racist man to abuse an elderly black woman and remain on the plane. It's 63 years since Rosa Parks said 'No' to sitting on the back of the Bus and we ain't going back.'

After a wave of pressure from social media users over why it failed to act, Ryanair wrote online yesterday: 'As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.'

A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'This incident, which we were made aware of (yesterday) morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport.

'Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation.'

Ryanair said that they were aware of the matter and had reported it to the police. The airline's chief financial officer declined to comment on the story.

""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation,"" the police said in a statement.

The video was taken by another passenger while the plane was waiting to take off from Barcelona to London Stansted airport on Friday.

After the argument, the woman was eventually moved from her seat. A flight attendant appears to tell the man he will discuss the incident with his supervisor, but the passenger is left in his place.

""I've seen airlines ground to a halt, and police called, and passengers escorted off of planes for less,"" David Lawrence, who recorded the video, told BBC Radio.

The police investigation comes as the Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, announced on Monday a 7 percent fall in profits in the first six months of the year. Ryanair has been grappling with the impact of recent strikes, high fuel costs and intense competition.

Britain's interior minister resigned earlier this year over the treatment of some Caribbean ""Windrush"" migrants who were invited to Britain after World War Two but were left without documents and denied basic rights, a scandal that highlighted persistent racial inequalities in British society.

Lawrence added that the woman, who he is in touch with, was from the Windrush generation, and that the frequency of such racist abuse made people numb to it.

""If the roles had been reversed, if that was a black man abusing an elderly, disabled white woman, I know that the outcome would have been completely different,"" he said.

One MP said Ryanair's 'perverse' incentives mean that its staff are unlikely to hold up a departing flight even if a delay is to kick off an abusive passenger.

Cabin crew seek to avoid delays because under the company's rules, they are paid only when flights have taken off.

The airline now faces the threat of a boycott over its handling of the incident on a flight from Barcelona to London last week.

Mrs Gayle yesterday expressed her disgust at Ryanair's failure to offer an apology and vowed never to fly with the airline again. 'They don't treat you with respect,' she said, suggesting staff would have reacted differently if a white passenger had been abused.

In a video of the incident filmed by a fellow passenger, Ryanair staff can be seen failing to intervene as the unidentified man calls Mrs Gayle a 'black b******' and an 'ugly f****** c***'.

The victim's family said yesterday that when they complained, Ryanair staff claimed they did not hear any racism.

Police in the UK were yesterday helping the Spanish authorities with an investigation into the incident amid calls for the abuser to face punishment in Britain.

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'What we saw was totally unacceptable, and racist abuse of that kind is a crime.

'If a crime is committed, it should be dealt with appropriately. I would hope... that the police would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case.'

Twitter was flooded with people hitting out at Ryanair's treatment of the pensioner

But shadow transport minister Karl Turner said Ryanair's failure to act when the plane was grounded in Spain means the racist will almost certainly face no punishment. He added: 'He should have been removed immediately from the aircraft and handed over to the Spanish authorities.

'They are under an awful lot of pressure to get the aircraft turned around. They've clearly made the wrong decision - he should have been ejected immediately.'

Mr Turner, a qualified barrister who was once Labour's shadow attorney general, said: 'There's a real chance that he won't be prosecuted as a result. I think Ryanair failed spectacularly. It should have been dealt with. He has committed grotesque criminal offences. This isn't just unruly, it is criminal.'

The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said there was nothing it could do. Dublin-based Ryanair is regulated by the Irish Aviation Authority. Because the incident took place before take-off, Spanish police would be responsible if the plane's doors were open.

The CAA said if the doors were closed, then the flight had officially begun and any criminal probe would have to be mounted by police in the country where the plane was registered. It is unclear where the aircraft was registered but the company's base is in Ireland.

A criminal act on board could be dealt with by British police if it took place after the plane had taken off for the UK.

Mr Turner said: 'The Crown Prosecution Service are going to be coming back to the police once they've reviewed this and will be telling police that they are not in a position to prosecute because of the jurisdictional point.

'That means he will get away with it scot-free. He will be banned, but that's not really a punishment when you've been racially abusing an elderly woman.'

Graham Stringer, a Labour member of the cross-party Commons transport committee, said the company's pay structure may have been to blame.

'Ryanair is an appalling airline which does not look after its passengers the way they should,' he said. 'But it also treats its staff badly and has perverse incentives in the system which may discourage them to hold up flights to deal with bad behaviour.' Cabin crew are paid for time in the air but not on the ground.

Like all airlines, Ryanair is also under pressure to hit punctuality targets. Under EU rules, airlines must pay compensation for heavily delayed or cancelled flights. Ryanair said yesterday the claim that its procedures were to blame was 'nonsense'.

The airline added that it had referred the matter to Essex Police, although it is thought that this only happened after the video of the incident prompted widespread condemnation.

Ryanair also claimed yesterday that its customer care team contacted the Gayle family on Sunday, although they contest this.

The family criticised Essex Police last night for contacting them to take a statement over the telephone, rather than in a face-to-face interview. The police force would not say whether it had spoken to the male passenger.

Huw Merriman, a Conservative member of the transport committee, said: 'Ryanair's staff should have been standing up for this poor woman who was the victim of racial abuse.

'Cabin crew clearly need better training. Action should be taken and this man should be hauled up in front of the courts.'

Labour MP David Lammy has led criticism of the airline by calling for a boycott and likening Mrs Gayle's experience to that of American civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks during the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955.

The spokesman, based at the Guardia Civil's national HQ in Madrid, said this morning: 'This passenger reported the incident to police in Essex.

'British police have told us verbally they are going to send us her statement so we can begin a formal investigation but we haven't received it yet. When it reaches us we will be a position to start investigating.'

He added: 'The paperwork will be sent through the normal official channels, via the liaison officers established as part of bilateral agreements between the two forces, but I don't expect it to take too long to reach us.

'If the man identified as the racist passenger is in the UK and he is accused of behaviour typified as a crime, then there will need to be more discussions with the British authorities.'

How Ryanair earns £6m a DAY from seating and luggage fees

Ryanair is squeezing more than £6million a day in extra charges from passengers, it emerged yesterday.

A surge in the number of people paying extra just to reserve a seat or bring a second bag on board has enabled the budget airline to generate £1.15billion from add-ons in just six months.

In results posted yesterday, the Irish-based carrier revealed the amount it generated from 'ancillary sales' soared by 27 per cent.

It includes everything apart from the fare and baggage fee - ranging from priority boarding to seats with extra legroom, snacks and sandwiches and car hire.

This has pushed up the average amount paid in extras per passenger to around £15.

Ryanair blamed strikes by cabin crew, pilots and air traffic controllers, as well as higher fuel costs, for dragging down its profit by 7 per cent to £1.06billion. A controversial crackdown in January meant passengers had to pay between £6 and £8 for priority boarding if they wanted to take a second, larger bag - such as a wheelie suitcase - on board the plane.

Ryanair insisted it was purely to cut down on delays caused by passengers bringing on more luggage than could fit in the overhead lockers. The airline also doubled the cost of seat reservation charges earlier this year while hiking the cost of extra legroom seats.

Seat reservation fees increased from £2 to £4 per passenger for one journey - or £8 for a return trip. Reserving a seat with extra legroom rose from £11 to £15 per journey. Parents with children under 12 have to pay £6 to guarantee they can sit with them.

The Civil Aviation Authority has been investigating the price of tickets and 'add-on charges' including booking and baggage fees.

One of the main focuses of the probe will be allegations some airlines are deliberately splitting families up unless they pay to reserve seats. The watchdog estimates this tactic is costing passengers up to £400million a year in fees.

Its initial findings show that on Ryanair more than one in three families are separated. The airline has strongly denied accusations it deliberately splits up families and says it allocates seats on a random basis.

But Guy Anker, managing editor at Moneysavingexpert, said: 'It is appalling if this is a deliberate tactic.' He added: 'These charges are not hidden, but they're still sneaky.'

A Ryanair spokesman said: 'Customers may choose to purchase additional products and services, the prices for which are fully transparent and displayed throughout the booking process.'

'I think Ryanair failed spectacularly. It should have been dealt with. He has committed grotesque criminal offences. This isn't just unruly, it is criminal.'

Ryanair victim: If I'd abused a white man, I would have been arrested

The grandmother who was subjected to a torrent of racist abuse on a Ryanair flight yesterday revealed that the ordeal has left her feeling depressed.

Delsie Gayle, 77, heaped criticism on the budget airline by questioning why they failed to remove the offending passenger despite watching him repeatedly abusing her.

Mrs Gayle and her family were in a state of 'utter shock' last night as the Irish airline had still not contacted them, despite a public outcry over its handling of the incident.

Delsie Gayle, 77, revealed that the ordeal on the plane has left her feeling depressed

Speaking publicly for the first time, the pensioner - part of the Windrush generation of immigrants - accused Ryanair of being inadvertently racist, claiming they would have reacted differently if a white passenger had been abused.

'I feel really depressed about it,' she said. 'I go to bed and say what have I done? I haven't done anything to attack him. Because of the colour of my skin. I was abused like that.

'I feel very low. He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.

'Why [is] he treating me because the colour of my skin, that's how I look isn't it? Because if I had done that to him I'm sure they would have called the police.'

Mrs Gayle, who came to Britain from the Caribbean in the 1960s, had been taken on holiday by her family to lift her morale ahead of the first anniversary of her husband Austin's death.

As they prepared to fly back to London from Barcelona-El Prat Airport on Friday, they encountered a tirade of abuse from a white male passenger.

The man, who has yet to be identified, became agitated at how long Mrs Gayle, who suffers from arthritis, took to move from her aisle seat as he tried to get to his window seat.

Mrs Gayle said: 'He said to me, 'Can you get up and let me come in?', so I said: 'In a minute.' He said: 'When I say get up, I mean you ought to get up'.

'So I said to him, 'Don't point your hand in my face' and he said 'I do what I want to do'.'

Airline staff then watched on without intervening as the abuser called Mrs Gayle a 'black b******' and threatened to push her off the row of seats they shared.

Mrs Gayle accused Ryanair of being inadvertently racist, claiming they would have reacted differently if a white passenger had been abused

During an emotional interview at her home in Leyton, East London, Mrs Gayle said: 'I know if I do it to him I know everyone on the plane would try to attack me.

'And because I'm black, I'm sad to say that, they didn't want to get involved with me.'

Following the abuse, she was eventually moved to another seat while the man remained in his seat, refusing to apologise.

'I didn't want to sit there and for him to abuse me any more,' said Mrs Gayle, who had been seated apart from her family. 'It made me feel really angry.'

Describing her frustration with Ryanair, she said: 'I decided I would not fly with that airline, because they don't treat you with respect.' Her daughter Carol, 53, who was also on the flight to Stansted, said: 'He should be moved or taken off the plane and nothing was done.

'I know if that was a black person racially abusing an elderly woman, the police would have been involved. It would have been a different matter. When I saw the video I felt like he [the abuser] was the victim, the way that Ryanair were treating it.

'Nobody has apologised. We've not had nothing. We just want an open apology from Ryanair. I can't even watch the video any more. It's just so upsetting.'

She said Ryanair staff refused to do anything, despite the family complaining that the abuser had used racist language, and said they were in a rush to board the next plane.

'I called the attendant and said, 'Look I told you to take him off, he's been shouting racial abuse',' she said. 'The flight attendant said he didn't hear any of that.

'He didn't hear any racial abuse. That's what he said. The captain or pilot came on and said there's nothing we can do now. We have got so many people that need to get on this plane.'

Both Mrs Gayle and her husband Austin were originally from Jamaica. After moving to the UK in 1965, Mrs Gayle spent more than two decades working as a care assistant.

A white man and a black woman can be seen with one seat between them while other outraged passengers try to calm the situation.

The incident happened on flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted on Friday afternoon.

The man (wearing glasses left and right) unleashed a torrent of racist abuse at the elderly woman sitting one seat away from him on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London Stansted

In the dramatic footage, which has been viewed more than one million times on Facebook, the man can be heard shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He replies: 'I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.'

The agitated man then jabs at the middle seat and continues yelling at the woman.

As he points he says: 'I hope somebody sits there because I don't want to sit next to you and your ugly face, your ugly f****** face.'

The woman tries to respond and a flight attendant can be seen trying to calm the situation.

But before she can say anything in response to the bully, he shouts over her and says: 'If you don't move to another seat I'll push you there.'

A man sitting in the row behind then tries to intervene, asking the man to calm down and tells him there's 'no need' for his aggressive behaviour.

Another man can be heard saying 'throw him off the flight. Get rid of him' as the flight attendant comes back to ask the angry man to 'calm down.'

The woman is then taken to another seat on the plane, away from the man.

The row apparently broke out after the elderly woman was unable to move out of her aisle seat quickly enough to let the man sit down in his window seat.

Another said: 'He should have been removed from the plane. No excuses for that type of behaviour.

'It's so sad that in today's society people still carry so much hatred inside them. When will we all realise we are all humans and all bleed the same way.'

A number of politicians voiced their concern at the incident.

MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: 'This is really appalling @Ryanair . You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.'

Fellow MSP politician Margaret Ferrier said: 'Just watched the shocking footage on a @Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed.

The daughter of the woman who was targeted said she believed if a black person had behaved in the same way they would have been thrown off the flight immediately.

The woman, 53, told the Huffington Post the row had started because her 77-year-old mother's arthritis meant it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

An elderly black woman who was racially abused by a male passenger on a Ryanair flight has been revealed as a Windrush generation widow.

Mrs Gayle had been returning from a holiday in Barcelona to mark the anniversary of her husbands death, her daughter told HuffPost UK.

But the 77-year-old found herself the victim of a fellow passenger, who targeted her with racially fuelled insults and demanded she be moved from her seat.

Now her daughter says she will never fly with the airline again after they decided to change her seat instead of removing the man from the flight.

'In a few weeks, it'll be one year since my dad died and I took my mum away for a few days' break,' Mrs Gayle's daughter, 53, said.

'My parents were married for over 50 years. She's been feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her spirits.

'The underlying reason behind the man's abusive behaviour comes down to the fact that my mum is a black woman and he didn't want her sitting next to him - he says it in the video.'

The passengers abusive words to Mrs Gayle were captured in a shocking video that has since gone viral.

In the footage, the man can be heard calling the pensioner, from East London, an 'ugly black bastard' and threatening to 'push' her if she doesn't sit elsewhere on the flight.

He can also be heard shouting 'don't talk to me in a fucking foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow' as Mrs Gayle attempts to speak to him.

Mrs Gayle, who did not want her first name used online, moved to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, where she built a life with her late husband and their children.

'This is black history month! My mother has worked her all of her life, paid her taxes and her dues,' her daughter said.

'Why should she have to go through all of this?'

The row began after her mother, who has arthritis, was slow standing up from her aisle seat in order to let the man pass through to the window seat.

It then ended with the pensioner being relocated on the plane, while the verbally aggressive man remained in his for the duration of the flight, telling passengers 'I'm alright, now she's gone'.

'I don't know how to go forward or where to take this,' Mrs Gayle's daughter said.

'I'm not even sure what I want done to resolve the situation, beyond an open apology to my mother for the way that the things were handled.'

She added: 'I know that if I was behaving like he was or any other black person, for that matter, police would've been called and we would've been kicked off of the flight.'

The pair have been advised to ring Ryanair's customer services on Monday.

Mrs Gayle's daughter says that when she complained about the situation at the time, cabin crew members denied hearing any use of racial slurs.

'Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief that she's already experiencing,' she said.

'As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with.

'We will never fly with Ryanair again.'

Ryanair responded to the video on Sunday by tweeting: 'We are aware of this video and have reported this matter to Essex Police.'

Eamonn Holmes brutally criticised Ryanair on live TV after the flight company refused to comment on a woman who was victim to racial abuse aboard their service.

Footage emerged earlier this week showing a man racially abuse Delsie Gayle, 77, aboard a flight from Barcelona to London, where he's seen calling her an 'ugly black bastard'.

Delsie appeared on This Morning with daughter Carol, and was reduced to tears as she explained the details behind the attack.

After branding the man 'horrible' and 'insidious', host Eamonn Holmes launched a scathing rant against Ryanair for refusing to comment or apologise over the incident.

Speaking on the show, Eamonn said: 'Now Ryanair will basically say: ""We've reported this to police in Essex. This is now a police matter and we can't comment further.'

Eamonn added: 'Ryan Air, you choose not to comment further. As usual, you have a reputation for treating your passengers with complete contempt and this is a terrible example of it.

'You could Ryan Air, say to us this morning, this is our side of the story, this is what we understood, we apologise for what went on but you choose not to speak. That's the difference.

'And the sad thing about all of this Carol is that it's an offense which happened in Spain, from a company that's registered in Ireland, being investigated by an English police force. The result will be nothing will happen. I tell you that now.'

Carol confirmed police are expected to take a statement from Delsie on Thursday, with hopes the man will be charged for racial abuse.

'They should be charged for racial abuse, definitely,' Carol said.

An elderly black woman who was racially abused on an Ryanair flight has told how the ordeal left her 'very low' and unable to eat or sleep.

Delsie Gayle, who is disabled, said she was left 'shocked' after becoming the target of a fellow passenger on her return flight from Barcelona on October 19.

The man, who was captured on video, called the 77-year-old an 'ugly black bastard' and demanded she be moved elsewhere on the plane.

'I feel very low. He paid a fare a to go on holiday, I've paid mine so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin?' she told ITV News.

'He do it with me and he gets away, he'll do it to somebody else,' she added.

Police have managed to find the man filmed racially abusing a woman next to him on a Ryanair flight.

Delsie Gayle, 77, who was called an 'ugly black bastard' and told 'don't speak to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow', will now be able to give police a statement about the incident, her daughter said.

Footage of the abuse taken by a fellow passenger was captured on Ryanair flight FR015 at Barcelona Airport on October 19, before it left for London Stansted.

Essex Police said today it had been contacted on Sunday about 'a racially-aggravated incident happening on a Ryanair plane while on the tarmac at Barcelona Airport'.

'Since the report was made to us our officers have identified both parties involved and are progressing a number of enquiries,' the force said.

'There are agreed national protocols to follow when incidents are reported to have happened in another country. As such, we will be conducting an investigation to submit to the Spanish authorities in due course.'

Speaking on ITV's This Morning on Tuesday, Mrs Gayle's daughter Carol said police had advised her that 'by Thursday they should be coming to mum for a statement'.

Mrs Gayle told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes said she was scared by the man's behaviour on the plane, adding: 'He was shouting - he went over and he said to the assistant 'get this ugly black bastard away from me'. I didn't say anything.'

She said he threatened to continue verbally abusing her, telling staff: 'I do what I want to do. If you don't move her, I'll carry on'.

'I was so frightened.'

Mrs Gayle added: 'I travel a lot, and I have never had this kind of reaction.

'I go to Canada, I go to Jamaica and never.'

Mrs Gayle's daughter had arranged the trip in an attempt to cheer her mother up a year after she was widowed.

She said: 'It's coming up to a year of my dad's death, so I thought I'd take my mum away just for a little mini-break.

'Mum was already feeling low because of Dad, and now with Ryanair it's made her feel more depressed.'

Nile Rodgers has claimed Ryanair staff wouldn't give him a glass of water for his cancer medication while on board a flight.

Taking to Twitter, the Le Freak singer shared a now-viral video of a man hurling racial abuse at a woman during a flight to London, from Barcelona.

Quoting the clip, he opened up about his own experience travelling with the company, telling his 197k followers: 'I wish someone had video tape of how @Ryanair treated me after I'd just had a #cancer operation and needed a simple glass of water to take medication.

'As in this case a passenger came to my aid because I didn't have the small amount of money for the water. UGH!'

Fans rushed to share their support for the 66-year-old, following his post.

'This is absolutely despicable. So sorry Ryanair was very rude to you, too, Nile,' one replied.

'So sorry you had to experience that treatment Nile. Completely unacceptable in both incidents,' another commented.

While a third wrote: 'Unbelievable! I'm glad another passenger helped you though, Nile. Ridiculous!'

And a fourth added: 'This is awful. Sorry about your bad experience too Nile.'

Nile underwent surgery to remove a cancerous growth on his kidney last year, later sharing the news in a blog post.

The Everybody Dance singer explained doctors found 'two different cancers within one mass' after he was taken to hospital with E. Coli.

He performed in Brooklyn last November, then flew to New York the next day to have the 'mass' removed - and was fighting fit and focusing on the future just a few weeks later.

Nile was previously diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, back in 2010, but thankfully got the all-clear three years later.

His post concerning Ryanair comes after it was revealed the racist passenger in question - who called the elderly woman in the seat next to him an 'ugly black bastard' - could 'get away with his behaviour'.

Footage circulating on Twitter - which has been viewed more than four million times - shows he shouted at the woman in question to move seats while her daughter tried to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

'I don't care whether she's fucking disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out,' he replied, before calling her 'an ugly fucking c**t' and telling staff to move her to another seat, adding: 'If you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat'.

Staff appeared to do little to diffuse the situation, moving the woman and her daughter while fellow passengers called for the man to be taken off the plane.

Labour MP for East Hull Karl Turner later said the airline 'failed spectacularly', tweeting: 'Suspect the pressure to turn this aircraft around quickly and get it airborne meant that they have allowed this alleged offender to remain on the aircraft. He may now get away with it.

Chris Hemsworth acts cute with kids during stroll in Byron Bay with wife Lisa Armstrong likes 'girl code breach' tweet after receiving 'legal warning from Ant'

'@Ryanair failure to deplane the alleged racist offender, handing him over to the Spanish authorities probably means that he isn't now prosecuted.

'Unfortunately because @Ryanair is registered in Dublin not in the UK the alleged offence could only be tried by UK authorities if it was ""in flight"" to the UK.

'If this incident had have happened on an alternative airline under ""British Control"" or it was already ""in flight"" to the UK the prosecuting authorities could have prosecuted.'

The announcement comes after customers threatened to boycott the airline because of its apparent inaction during the incident, which occurred on a plane flying from Barcelona to London Stansted.

Footage of the unnamed man calling the pensioner an ""ugly black bastard"", has been viewed on Facebook more than 1.8 million times.

The budget airline told the BBC: ""We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this.

""We will be taking this matter further and disruptive or abusive behaviour like this will result in passengers being banned from travel.""

Ryanair said in a separate statement it was aware of the footage and had reported the incident to Essex Police. ""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further"", it added.

But Essex Police said the incident happened on a plane at Barcelona Airport and it was not immediately clear who was leading the investigation

The row apparently broke out after the 77-year-old woman was unable to move out of her aisle seat quickly enough to let the man sit down in his window seat.

The video, shot by UK resident David Lawrence, shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats, while her daughter tells him her mother is disabled.

He replies: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

The flight attendant then asks the woman if she would like to move to another seat and the woman tells him she would like to sit near her daughter.

The man tells her to move seat, to which the woman responds: ""You smell. You need a wash.""

Then, the man says: ""If you don't go to another seat, I'll push you to another seat.""

Later, he says: ""Don't talk to me in a f****** foreign language you stupid ugly cow.""

A fellow passenger tries to intervene, asking the man to stop being abusive.

But the man says: ""I will carry on as far as I can with this ugly black bastard.""

The flight attendant says the man is being ""super rude"" and tells him to calm down, while a number of passengers on the flight call for the man to be removed from the flight.

Politicians and social media users have strongly criticised the airline for not asking him to leave the plane.

The woman's daughter said she had gone on holiday to Barcelona with her mother to mark a year since the death of her husband.

She told The Huffington Post: ""I know that if I was behaving like he was - or any other black person for that matter - police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight.

""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing.""

A number of politicians voiced their concern at Ryanair's apparent lack of action during the altercation.

MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: ""This is really appalling Ryanair. You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.""

Fellow MSP politician Margaret Ferrier said: ""Just watched the shocking footage on a Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed.

""Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately. However well done to passenger with black T-shirt that intervened.""

In a later tweet she said the woman had been referred to Ryanair's customer services, describing the response as ""a joke"".

In the video, filmed by a fellow passenger, a white man can be heard shouting at a black woman, calling her an ""ugly black bastard"". When the woman responds in a Jamaican accent, the man shouts ""Don't talk to me in a f***ing foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow."" He threatens to ""push"" her if she doesn't leave her seat.

Instead of removing this man from their flight, Ryanair escort the woman, who we now know is Mrs Gayle, a 77-year-old member of the Windrush generation, to a new row. Since the video went viral - a factor which must have complicated and possibly compounded the victim's trauma - she has apparently received no apology from the airline. Mrs Gayle's family told Nadine White at HuffPost UK that they are ""surprised, disgusted and hurt"" by this lack of contrition.

Politicians have also denounced the behaviour of the airline. The secretary of state for transport, Chris Grayling, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What we saw was totally unacceptable. The fact is that race abuse of that kind is a crime. And if a crime is committed it should be dealt with appropriately."" Theresa May's spokesman has said: ""When people are travelling, going about their public life, no-one should be subjected to intimidation or any form of abuse."" People have been quick to comment on the irony of this statement in light of the hostile environment policy and the detentions and deportations of the Windrush Generation.

MP David Lammy, who recently demanded that Theresa May immediately introduce a hardship fund for Windrush citizens whose compensation schemes have been delayed, has also commented on the Ryanair incident. He tweeted: ""Ok boycott @Ryanair if they think it's ok for a racist man to abuse an elderly black woman and remain on the plane. It's 63 years since Rosa Parks said ""No "" to sitting on the back of the Bus and we ain't going back.""

The comparison is striking. In yesterday's episode of Doctor Who, written by Malorie Blackman, we saw the Tardis land in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. We're introduced to the political landscape of Rosa Parks's America, when we see Ryan, a young black boy played by the actor Tosin Cole, being slapped across the face for trying to return the glove of a white woman.

The optimistic but hard-hitting episode focuses on how far we've come since the inception of the civil rights movement, while also reminding us how far we have left to go. In one particularly moving scene, Ryan and Yas are hiding from a police officer. Ryan reminds Yas that ""this ain't history"", and that racism isn't a thing of the past. He says, ""I'm having to work so hard to keep my temper.""

The episode was a sobering reminder of the fact that, whether or not they retaliate, black people are treated as aggressors in scenarios where they are really the victims. In the Ryanair video, we see that Mrs Gayle is moved from her seat, instead of her white verbal assailant being removed from the flight and reported to the authorities. It's as though she shared responsibility for the incident; like it was an argument, rather than an attack.

And if this is how a vulnerable female pensioner is treated, imagine how young black men, riled by racial abuse, are responded to by officials. The racist stereotype that black people are innately confrontational or aggressive is not a coincidence; it is a hugely effective oppressive tool. Because abuse is likely to provoke anger and retaliation, and black people are the most likely to receive racial abuse, we are taught to perceive those natural human reactions as evidence that the abuse was provoked.

The idea that black people must have somehow been complicit in their own mistreatment is so deeply entrenched that a frail pensioner was treated like a scrapper in a pub brawl, moved away from her abuser as he assures people ""I'm alright"".

He replies: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

The flight attendant then asks the woman if she would like to move to another seat and the woman tells him she would like to sit near her daughter.

The Ryanair employee tells the man that the airline does not tolerate abusive behaviour and says he will discuss the matter further with his supervisor.

However, staff purportedly allowed him to stay on the flight.

On Sunday, Ryanair put out a statement on Twitter failing to apologise, only saying: ""We are aware of this video and have reported this matter to Essex Police.""

Ryanair also warns: ""The risk of a hard ('no-deal') Brexit in March 2019 is rising. While we hope that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), we remain concerned that the time to complete such an agreement is shortening.""

It has already warned that flights between the UK and EU could be grounded temporarily if no aviation agreement is reached.

""In the event of a hard Brexit our UK shareholders will be treated as non-EU. In such an event the board will restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders (and confine them to selling shares only to EU nationals) to ensure that Ryanair remains majority owned and controlled by EU shareholders.""

The airline says that average fares have fallen by 3 per cent due to excess capacity in Europe. It also blames strikes and staff shortages at air-traffic control (ATC) centres, ""which caused a spike in cancellations of higher fare, weekend flights"".

While revenue from ancillaries - from seat reservations to on-board sales - have risen by 27 per cent, the airline has incurred sharply increased costs for fuel and staff, with pilots receiving pay rises of up to 20 per cent.

Passenger welfare costs have also increased. Customers whose flights are cancelled are entitled to hotel beds and meals. Seats on replacement flights also represent significant costs.

Michael O'Leary said: ""Our traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC disruptions on record, grew 6 per cent at an unchanged 96 per cent load factor.""

Ryanair recognised trades unions only in December 2017, and since then has suffered a series of coordinated stoppages by pilots and cabin crew. The airline claims that in Germany, Spain and Portugal, ""competitor employees have interfered to delay agreements with our people and their unions"".

It warns: ""While we hope to finalise more union agreements in the coming months, we cannot rule out occasional industrial action, but we expect their impact to be very limited.""

After the collapse of Primera Air and Cobalt of Cyprus so far this month, Ryanair says: ""It is inevitable that more of the weaker, unhedged, European airlines will fold this winter.""

""We expect more failures this winter and we cannot rule out further capacity cuts or base closures in Ryanair if oil prices rise or air fares fall further.

""Over the medium term, this consolidation will create growth opportunities for Ryanair's lowest fare/lowest cost model.

""Winter trading may be positively impacted by the rate and timing of other airline failures which is already creating a ready supply of well trained pilots and cabin crew for summer 19 growth.""

The airline says that 90 per cent of its fuel requirements are hedged at $68 per barrel, below the current spot prices of over $80, but estimates its fuel bill will be €460m (£405m) higher than last year.

At the start of October the airline's shares dropped 10 per cent when it cut its profits forecast by €150m (£133m), blaming the effects of strikes and the rising cost of oil.

The airline's bases at Eindhoven in the Netherlands and Bremen in Germany are to be closed for the winter, while two of the five aircraft at Niederrhein in western Germany will be removed.

Ryanair remains by far the most profitable airline in Europe, as well as the safest in the world when measured by passengers carried without a fatal accident.

It has faced intense criticism over an incident in which a white male on a flight about to depart from Barcelona to Stansted launched a tirade of racist abuse against a black fellow passenger.

British police have launched an investigation after mobile phone footage emerged of a man calling 77-year-old Delsie Gayle an ""ugly black b******"" and a ""stupid ugly cow"" during the shocking encounter.

The story has gone viral, with US media networks including CNN and ABC News reporting on the incident, heaping pressure on the airline to explain why he was not booted off.

Instead, Ms Gayle of Leyton, East London, was forced to move from her seat after the man threatened to push her, on the plane from Barcelona to London.

The man had demanded that she get out of his way and became angry when she did not move quickly enough for him. He warned her not to speak in a foreign language although the Jamaican-born woman was speaking English.

The torrent of abuse continued despite the efforts of a crew member and a passenger sitting behind.

It later emerged that Ms Gayle had travelled to Barcelona to commemorate the one-year anniversary of her husband's death. She told ITV News yesterday that she felt ""very low"" since the incident.

""I was shocked, nobody ever said those words to me,"" she said. ""I feel very low. He paid a fare to go on holiday, I've paid mine, so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin?""

""He does it with me and he gets away, he'll do it to somebody else,"" she added.

A Ryanair spokesman last night told the Irish Independent that its customer care team had contacted the Gayle family on Sunday. It has also reported the incident to police in Essex.

""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further,"" he added.

Essex Police said it had launched an investigation and was working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities.

British Labour MP David Lammy backed a boycott of the airline, and recalled Rosa Parks's famous stand against discrimination and said ""we ain't going back"".

The party's transport spokesperson, Karl Turner, claimed Ryanair ""failed spectacularly"" and he suspected pressure to take off meant the alleged offender stayed on board.

He said the man may ""get away with it"" because the incident happened in Spain, and he probably could not be prosecuted in Britain.

The Irish Labour Party's transport spokesperson Kevin Humphries said he would not back a boycott until he knew the full facts.

However, he described the incident as horrendous and said the captain should have put the man off the plane.

""I want to see a full investigation,"" he said. ""This is an Irish-based company and we can't tolerate things like that happening on a plane. The captain is in charge at the time of the incident, but the airline needs to set down clear guidelines.""

Fianna Fáil's transport spokesperson, Robert Troy, said it was beyond question that Ryanair should have handled the situation better. He said there were questions over whether aviation laws were fit for purpose to deal with such incidents. ""I will be seeking assurances from Ryanair management that proper protocols and training are now in place to ensure there is no repeat of this incident and that racism is appropriately dealt with any time it raises its ugly head,"" he said.",news,2018-10-23,2018-10-23T01:42:00Z,eng-4364609,0.0,eng,0.5960784554481506,01:42:00,'I feel very low': elderly victim of racist tirade on plane,976050841,https://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/britain/i-feel-very-low-elderly-victim-of-racist-tirade-on-plane-37448292.html,independent.ie,news,Independent.ie,7,David,0

Ryanair chief commercial officer David O'Brien yesterday pointed to expansion possibilities in France and other established markets. The airline recently announced that two bases will open in France next year, with more to follow. Mr O'Brien said that Ryanair is likely to double its presence in France over the next 18 months. Next summer, more that 50pc of the airline's growth is targeted at its top three markets.

But Michael O'Leary said that the group's real growth will come from outside the main Ryanair operating unit.

Ryanair acquired 75pc of Austrian low-cost carrier Laudamotion this year. According to Mr O'Leary, Ryanair is likely to acquire the remaining 25pc of Laudamotion from Niki Lauda in the next 12 to 24 months.

Ryanair is doubling the size of its Ryanair Sun scheduled and charter operation in Poland next summer to about 20 aircraft. Laudamotion will be a similar size next summer, but Mr O'Leary has previously signalled that it will eventually increase to at least 30 aircraft.

Meanwhile, Ryanair also expects to have a UK air operator's certificate (AOC) by the end of this year that will allow it to keep operating its domestic routes there post-Brexit.

""We expect over the next number of years that much of our growth will take place through either the Ryanair Sun vehicle in Poland, and/or, LaudaMotion in Austria and in Germany,"" said Mr O'Leary.

Delsie Gayle was called an ""ugly black b******"" by a white man sitting next to her on a flight from Barcelona to London Stansted on Friday.

The 77-year-old's ordeal sparked outrage after footage of the abuse was captured by a fellow passenger and posted on Facebook.

The row apparently broke out after Ms Gayle was unable to move out of her aisle seat quickly enough to let the man sit down in his window seat.

""I feel really depressed about it. I go to my bed and say, 'What have I done?' I haven't done anything (for him) to attack me because of the colour of my skin,"" she told ITV News.

Ms Gayle, a member of the Windrush generation who moved to Britain in the 1960s, tearfully revealed she did not know when she would recover from the incident ""because every time I remember I cry.""

""I feel very low, because he paid his fare to go on holiday, I paid mine, so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin?"" she said, adding if the man gets away with it he will do it to someone else.

A British pensioner who was racially abused by a passenger on a Ryanair flight has argued the airline would have removed her from the plane had the situation been reversed.

The 77-year-old wept as she told ITV News that she has had no response from Ryanair and said the incident left her feeling depressed.

She said she still hadn't heard from the airline about the situaton which took place on Friday.

Mrs Gayle said: ""I feel very low. He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.

""He should have moved and I didn't want to sit there and for him to abuse me anymore.""

Talking about seeing the footage of the incident she said: ""It made me feel really angry.

""Why [is] he treating me because the colour of my skin, that's how I look isn't it? Because if I had done that to him I'm sure they would have called the police take away with me.""

She said: ""I feel really depressed about it. I go to bed and say what have I done?

""I haven't done anything to attack him. Because of the colour of my skin. I was abused like that.""

She added: ""Then he was going out I look at him and he looked at me and he didn't say sorry.

""Because I know if I do it to him I know everyone on the plane would try to attack me. And because I'm black, I'm sad to say that, they didn't want to get involved with me.

""Well I decided I would not fly with that airline, because they don't treat you with no respect.""

She wept as she said: ""I was shocked because I've never had that done on holiday before. I was shocked. I said why. Because of the colour of my skin, why he do that.""

Her daughter Carol, who was travelling with her mother, said he should have been moved or taken off the plane but claimed nothing was done.

She added: ""And I know if that was a black person racially abusing an elderly woman the police would have been involved. It would have been a different matter.

""When I saw the video I felt like he was the victim.""

She criticised the way Ryanair staff handled the abuse and said: ""On the plane was unprofessional and after was unprofessional. It's all wrong. I just believe they need more training on this anti-social...

""Nobody has apologised. We've not had nothing. We just want an open apology from Ryanair.

""I can't even watch the video anymore. It's just so upsetting.""

Referring to the response from fellow passengers on the flight, Carol said it seemed like people didn't want to get involved.

She added: ""Once we landed, I called the attendant and said look I told you to take him off, he's been shouting racial abuse.

""The flight attendant said he didn't hear any of that. He didn't hear any racial abuse.

""That's what he said. The captain or pilot came on and said there's nothing we can do now.

""We have got so many people that need to get on this plane. You'll have to take it up with Ryanair when you get off.""

She added: ""We haven't heard from Ryanair.

""We're just upset with the way they've dealt with it. Nothing was done, he wasn't moved. And we've had no apology or nothing.

""He knew what he was doing.""

She said: ""I would sum it up with...they just didn't care. They were more interested in the man and him being the victim, they didn't care about my mum.""

The footage has sparked widespread outrage, with even the Prime Minister commenting.

Theresa May's spokesman said: ""When people are travelling, going about their public life, no-one should be subjected to intimidation or any form of abuse.

""The PM has always been clear that racial abuse is abhorrent.

""In relation to this particular case there is obviously an investigation which is being conducted by Essex Police and it is right that I don't comment specifically on that.""

A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: ""This incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport.

""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported.

Ryanair has just given holidaymakers the perfect excuse to beat the Monday blues by slashing prices on one MILLION seats to £9.99 each way.

Basically, great news for those on a budget looking for cheap flights to Europe this winter.

The discounted seats are available for travel dates from November to March, ideal timing for those who are thinking of exploring Europe's best Christmas markets or who are already thinking ahead to February half term in 2019.

The cheap fares are already available on the airline's website but you'll need to be very, very quick if you want to bag a bargain as the sale is only on for 24 hours, ending at midnight today (Monday 22nd October).

Those flying from London Stansted can also find a host of discounted flights with more prices under a tenner with prices at £9.78 to plenty of popular destinations including Barcelona, Bordeaux, Milan and Warsaw.

There's a wide choice of UK airports too including London Gatwick, Luton, Edinburgh, Manchester, East Midlands, Bristol, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Liverpool, Newcastle and Leeds Bradford.

Of course it's worth noting that the cheap rates won't include extras such as priority boarding, or the baggage fees for those planning to bring more than one piece of hand luggage under Ryanair's new cabin bag policy .

Still, it's good timing for those planning a festive getaway, or for travellers who are thinking of using up the last of that annual leave on a European mini break.

Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: ""We've launched a 'Million-Air' seat sale with one million £9.99 seats across our entire European network for travel from November to March, ensuring Ryanair customers can holiday like millionaires, on the lowest fares.

""This amazing offer will end at midnight (24:00hrs) on Tuesday (23 Oct), so customers should log on quickly and bag a bargain break.""

He told BBC Breakfast: ""I had to make a difficult decision at that time because if I had stepped in I don't think you would have seen the footage that I captured.""

Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman declined to comment on the specific case, but told reporters: ""When people are travelling and going about their public life, no-one should be subjected to intimidation or any form of abuse.

""The Prime Minister has always been clear that racial abuse is abhorrent.

""In relation to this particular case, there's obviously an investigation being conducted by Essex Police and it's right that I don't comment specifically on that.""

The video, recorded on October 19 on flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted before the plane had taken off, shows a man shouting at a woman telling her to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He said: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

In the video the man can be heard calling the elderly woman an ""ugly black b******"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow"".

He was not confronted by any other passengers, Mr Lawrence added.

""In fact, one of the passengers whilst I was filming basically said to me don't you think you're being a bit childish by filming this,"" he said.

Ally Murphy, a former cabin crew supervisor who also appeared on the radio show, said Mr Lawrence made the right call in deciding to film the incident.

""It is great that David did film that,"" she said. ""This happens every day in the community and people need to step forward and say this isn't right.""

""But as a cabin crew member it is not great when people pile in and try to take things into their own hands,"" she added.

When contacted by the Irish Independent, a spokesman for Ryanair said: ""We have reported this to the police in Essex and as this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

A Ryanair passenger who was racially abused on a flight broke down in tears as she watched footage of the racist tirade.

Delsie Eunice Gayle, 77, admitted she had been left ""depressed and upset"" by the shocking incident captured on October 19 on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted

A vile passenger was filmed calling the elderly woman a ""ugly black b*****d"" as well as shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow"".

Delsie was visibly upset as she watched the horrific footage ahead of an interview on today's This Morning.

The pensioner claimed the police would have ""locked her up"" if the situation had been reversed.

She said: ""I feel low because I travel a lot and have never got this sort of reaction. I turned and said if it was me they would have called the police and locked me up.

""It's because the colour of my skin I am being treated like this.""

Revealing details of her ordeal, Delsie said: ""He said can you move. I said okay give me a bit of time don't shout. He said 'when I say move you have to move'.

""He was shouting. He went over, I didnt look at him, he said to the assistant 'get this ugly black b*****d away from here'. I didn't say anything to him. He was there abusing me, I didn't say anything.""

Delsie, who has worked for 25 years as a car assistant, was joined by her daughter Carol Gayle on the sofa.

Carol said: ""Mum has been feeling really low and depressed. It's coming up to a year since my dad's death. I wanted to take her away to lift her spirits.

""We had a lovely time. To come back and finish with this was horrible.""

Delsie's daughter hit out at Ryanair staff who failed to come to help her mum.

On their reaction, she said: ""I was surprised. I had said from the beginning he should be taken off. I was shocked. I called all the flight attendants but only one was dealing with it.

""I asked the gentleman, he said 'I never heard anything'. The head attendant in charge said 'I was told about something but I didn't think it was serious enough'.""

Ryanair is facing growing criticism because the victim was moved to another seat while the abuser was allowed to continue his journey.

The budget airline has now said the man has been reported to Essex police following the aggressive incident on Friday.

Carol argued he should be ""charged for racial abuse"", while Delsie confirmed she would never fly with Ryanair again.

Furious Eamonn Holmes said: ""Ryanair you choose not to comment further. As usual you treat your customers with utter contempt.""

A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: ""This incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport.

A Ryanair passenger who launched a racist tirade 'may get away with it' because the flight had not taken off, Labour's transport spokesman has claimed.

The passenger was filmed calling the elderly woman a ""ugly black b*****d"" - as well as shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow"".

The shocking incident was captured on October 19 on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted by Kent resident David Lawrence, who uploaded it to social media.

The footage has sparked widespread outrage, with even Transport Secretary Chris Grayling demanding police intervention over the incident.

However, Labour politician Karl Turner says because the incident happened on Spanish soil, and Ryanair is an Irish company, British police may be powerless to act.

The East Hull MP wrote on Twitter : ""Suspect the pressure to turn this aircraft around quickly and get it airborne meant that they have allowed this alleged offender to remain on the aircraft.

""He may now get away with it.""

Turner, who is a qualified barrister, says the incident is not covered by UK law because it happened before the plane took off.

""@Ryanair failure to deplane the alleged racist offender, handing him over to the Spanish authorities probably means that he isn't now prosecuted.""

He added: 'Unfortunately because @Ryanair is registered in Dublin not in the UK the alleged offence could only be tried by UK authorities if it was ""in flight"" to the UK. Section 92(1) Civil Aviation Act s.92(4) defines 'in flight'.

""If this incident had have happened on an alternative airline under ""British Control"" or it was already ""in flight"" to the UK the prosecuting authorities could have prosecuted.""

The row apparently broke out after the elderly woman was unable to move out of her aisle seat quickly enough to let the bully sit down in his window seat.

Do you know the man in the video? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk

It shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He replies: ""I don't care whether shes f******g disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out"".

The man then calls her ""an ugly f*****g c***"" and tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: ""If you don't go to another seat, I'll push you to another seat"".

Cabin crew can be heard asking the man to calm down and stop being rude and asking the elderly woman if she would like to be moved to another seat, while other passengers call for him to be removed.

The victim can be heard telling the bully he stinks and needs a wash, before eventually asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter.

One man wearing black T-shirt sat behind the pair became so concerned that he stood up and used his hands to separate the pair, repeatedly telling the angry man to stop being so abusive.

""Stop. There's no need for that at all,"" he tells the shouting man. ""Just stop. Take it easy. Stop, please.""

Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""What we saw was totally unacceptable.

""And the fact is that abuse of that kind, race abuse of that kind, is a crime. And if a crime is committed it should be dealt with appropriately.

""And so therefore I would hope, notwithstanding what took place on that day, that police would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case.""

The passenger who intervened was praised by former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier, who took to Twitter to share her shock at the video.

""Just watched the shocking footage on a Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting,"" she wrote.

""Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed. Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately.

""However, well done to passenger with black t-shirt that intervened #hero.""

Ryanair have refused to comment further about the incident as the matter is now in police hands.

A spokeswoman for Essex Police said: ""This incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport.

""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported.

Ryanair is facing growing criticism after one of their passengers unleashed a furious, racist tirade at an elderly disabled woman - before the victim was moved to another seat while the abuser was allowed to continue his journey.

In an interview with the Huffington Post on Sunday, the victim's daughter said her 77-year-old mother is a member of the Windrush generation who was on the way back from a holiday to mark the first anniversary of her husband's death.

The footage was recorded on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stanstead on October 19 by UK resident David Lawrence, who uploaded it to Facebook with the caption 'share & shame'.

The same video has been retweeted 23,000 times after it was uploaded onto Twitter by user @StanceGrounded.

Several other politicians have expressed concern at Ryanair's reaction to the incident.

Labour MP for East Hull and shadow Attorney General Karl Turner tweeted: ""He should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police.

""We assume the aircraft was in the UK. If it was he definitely committed criminal offences. I fully expect Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight.""

MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: ""This is really appalling Ryanair . You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.""

Broadcaster Jeremy Vine also joined the criticism, tweeting: ""If this is Ryanair, they need to explain how this man's disgusting racial abuse of the black lady in the seat next to him ends up with HER being asked to move. It is beyond belief.""

The budget airline tweeted on Sunday that it had seen the footage and reported the incident to Essex police.

It added: ""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

Essex police said: ""Essex police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported.

41,"[{'uri': 'amy_wang@independent.ie', 'name': 'Amy Wang', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}]","David Lawrence had just settled into seat 22F when he heard a commotion on the other side of the plane.

A few rows behind him, a ruddy-faced man with grey hair and glasses was shouting at a black woman seated along the aisle.

""I heard this man shouting at this woman, saying, 'You're in my way, get out! I don't want you here next to me!',"" Mr Lawrence said. ""I couldn't believe what I heard.""

Mr Lawrence grabbed his phone and started to record the encounter, which took place before the Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London Stansted Airport. By then, the woman's daughter had come up and confronted the man.

""She said, 'Who are you talking to? Don't shout at her, that's my mother, she's disabled',"" Mr Lawrence recalled, noting that the elderly woman had boarded the plane in a wheelchair. ""He then was saying, 'I don't care'.""

In the video, the man can be heard shouting back at the younger black woman, all while other passengers continue shuffling down the aisle.

A male flight attendant with his back to Mr Lawrence's camera attempts to calm the situation, to little effect.

""I tell you, I hope somebody sits there,"" the man tells the elderly woman, gesturing toward the empty middle seat between them.

""Because I don't want to sit next to your..."" The rest of the sentence is unclear, though he appears to call her ""sickly"", ""fat"" and ""ugly"".

The flight attendant then asks the woman whether she would like to sit elsewhere.

""Put her to another seat!"" the man shouts, before turning to the woman. ""I tell you this. If you don't go to another seat, I'll put you to another seat!""

The elderly woman says something back, prompting the man to retort angrily: ""Don't talk to me in a f***ing foreign language, you stupid ugly cow!"" and then ""Ugly black bastard!""

The shouting had a mixed effect on surrounding passengers. One man, wearing a black T-shirt and sitting in the row directly behind, physically tried to intervene, sticking his hand between the seats in front of him and telling the man to keep his voice down.

""Stop,"" the man in the black shirt pleads.

""There's no need for that at all. Just stop. It's really easy to close your mouth.""

Mr Lawrence, while recording the video, can be heard saying, ""Throw him off the flight. Get rid of him!""

Eventually, the elderly woman asks to sit next to her daughter and begins to move out of the row, visibly fed-up.

To his surprise, Mr Lawrence said, the flight took off shortly afterward, with no apparent repercussions for the male passenger.

""I thought the flight attendant was going to call someone and escort the man off the flight,"" Lawrence said. ""They moved the woman instead of moving him. That was shocking to me.""

He decided to upload his video to Facebook the following day out of frustration.

""It was just so disturbing,"" he said. ""Because there was no response from the other passengers on the flight at the time, I thought, OK, well, somebody needs to know what happened here. That's why I kept the video running and captured as much as I could.""

Over the weekend, the video had nearly three million views and has been shared tens of thousands of times. Mr Lawrence later uploaded the video to YouTube, where it has more than 100,000 views.

Scores of commenters expressed outrage over how the matter was handled and demanded to know why Ryanair's flight crew didn't remove the male passenger before the plane took off.

Representatives for Ryanair did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, the Irish airline said in a Twitter post that it had reported the incident to Essex Police.

""We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this,"" Ryanair told the BBC.

""We will be taking this matter further and disruptive or abusive behaviour like this will result in passengers being banned from travel.""

The elderly woman was later named as Delsie Gayle. Her daughter told HuffPost UK that her mother is a 77-year-old retiree who immigrated to Britain from Jamaica in the 1960s.

They were returning from a holiday to mark the anniversary of the death of Ms Gayle's husband, she said.

Mr Lawrence (56) said he spoke to Ms Gayle and her daughter after the flight and said they were both disappointed and disgusted.

His parents also were part of the 'Windrush generation', immigrants who moved from the Caribbean to Britain from 1948 to 1971, so Mr Lawrence said he could understand why the Ms Gayle agreed to switch seats rather than escalate the situation.

""The racism they suffered on a daily basis is historic. Our parents have learned over the years - because they have never received any kind of justice - they've just learned to live with it,"" Lawrence said.

""They kind of have this attitude, like, 'Well, what can we do?' sort of thing. The lady was like, 'this has happened so many times. I just want to go home'.""

Ryanair has reported a dip in half year profits after the budget airline was stung by higher fuel costs and compensation payouts linked to flight delays and cancellations.

The Irish carrier booked a 9% decline in pre-tax profits to 1.3 billion euros £1.1 billion) in the six months to September 30.

Ryanair, which was forced to issue a profit warning earlier this month, said higher fuel and staff and compensation costs offset strong revenue growth, which rose 8% to 4.79 billion euros (£4.2 billion).

The budget airline added that average fares declined 3% due to excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, and repeated strikes and staff shortages which caused a spike in cancellations of higher fare, weekend flights.

Ryanair has also been stung by pilot and cabin crew strikes, knocking passenger numbers and resulting in hefty compensation costs.

It has also hit customer confidence in the company, with passengers making fewer forward bookings into the third quarter including for the October school half-term and Christmas.

That was on top of rising oil prices, which have bumped up Ryanair's fuel bill by 22% to 1.3 billion euros (£1.1 billion).

Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: ""As recently guided, first half average fares fell by 3%. While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27%, these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 (compensation) costs.

""Our traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC (air traffic control) disruptions on record, grew 6% at an unchanged 96% load factor.""

""We have trimmed winter capacity by 1% (including base closures in Eindhoven and Bremen) in response to weaker fares and higher oil prices.""

Looking ahead, Ryanair said it now expects annual traffic growth of 6% to 138 million passengers - slightly down on previous guidance of 139 million - following a 1% reduction in winter capacity.

The airline's fuel bill is expected to come in about 460 million euros higher year-on-year.

Ryanair said that its profit guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further, and the absence of unforeseen strikes and negative Brexit developments.

""The risk of a hard (""no-deal"") Brexit in March 2019 is rising. While we hope that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), we remain concerned that the time to complete such an agreement is shortening,"" O'Leary added.",news,2018-10-22,2018-10-22T07:57:00Z,eng-4364609,0.0,eng,0.3725490272045135,07:57:00,Ryanair profits fall after strikes spark thousands of compensation payouts,975352556,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/ryanair-profits-fall-after-strike-13457051,mirror.co.uk,news,Mirror,7,David,0

The man was filmed by a fellow passenger calling the elderly woman an ""ugly black b******"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow"".

The footage was recorded on Friday on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted by Kent resident David Lawrence.

It shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He replies: ""I don't care whether she's f***ing disabled or not - if I tell her to get out, she gets out.""

The man then calls her ""an ugly f***ing c***"" and tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: ""If you don't go to another seat, I'll push you to another seat.""

Staff on the flight intervened but were unable to silence the man during the footage.

A passenger in the row behind intervened to try to defuse the situation.

The cabin crew can be heard to say: ""Don't be so rude, you have to calm down"", while other passengers call for the man to be thrown off the flight.

The woman can be heard telling the man that he stinks and he needs a wash, before asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter. The daughter of the woman who was targeted said she believed if a black person had behaved in the same way, they would have been thrown off the flight immediately.

The woman (53) told the 'Huffington Post' the row had started because her 77-year-old mother's arthritis meant it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

The daughter said she had taken her mother on holiday to mark one year since the death of her father.

""My parents were married over 50 years. She's been feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her spirits.

""I know that if I was behaving like he was, or any other black person for that matter, police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight.

""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing. As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with,"" she said.

The woman said when she complained to cabin crew, they denied hearing any racial slurs and they told her to ring customer services on Monday.

News of the incident was retweeted 18,000 times, prompting widespread condemnation of Ryanair for failing to do more.

When contacted by the Irish Independent, a spokesman for Ryanair said: ""We have reported this to the police in Essex and as this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

Then keeping his seat while she was asked if she wanted to move. Ryanair reportedly said that the cabin crew were not aware of the racist slurs. This appalling chain of events, which will not be shocking to anyone who has been on the receiving end of racist abuse, tells us everything we need to know about how racism is routinely handled in our country.

The film shows the man threatening to ""push"" the woman to another seat. The woman, a 77-year-old member of the Windrush generation who is returning from a holiday with her daughter to mark the death of her husband, has arthritis. Apparently she takes too long to move. The man calls her an ""ugly black bastard"" and shouts ""don't talk to me in a foreign language"" when she replies in English. Eventually, a flight attendant intervenes. A passenger confronts the man.

The outcome? The woman is moved. The man remains locked in his white privilege, his racist hatred, and his seatbelt. Ryanair, which once ordered five black musicians to leave a flight at gunpoint after a passenger complained they looked like terrorists, has referred the matter to Essex police.

When I watch this footage, I begin to sweat. My heart hammers. I freeze while violent emotional weather batters my inner landscape. I find it impossible to speak. Though I am not someone who struggles to stick up for myself, every time I have been hit by the sucker punch of racism, whether from a well-meant comment at a dinner party or abuse hurled from a passing car, I have been powerless to defend myself. I am literally gagged by shame. And whenever I have experienced abuse in public, no one has intervened. Not one person. Racism tends to be met with silence, embarrassment, or, worse, denial.

We are living in the midst of a surge in hate crime and an establishment that seems hell-bent on legitimising far-right, racist views, whether through a newspaper column by a former foreign secretary inciting Islamophobia or the invitation of Steve Bannon to a conference co-hosted by our public service broadcaster. How we respond matters more than ever. We can all do more to combat freshly emboldened racism but some can do more than others because some bystanders, such as white people and men, possess more power and thus more responsibility. So when people of colour experience racism, we need white allies to stand up and fight.

A Ryanair passenger who launched a racist tirade at a fellow passenger may ""get away with it"" due to the airline wanting to get the plane off the ground, a shadow transport minister said.

The man was filmed calling the elderly woman in the seat next to him an ""ugly black b******"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow"".

Ryanair sparked outrage after apparently failing to remove the man , with Labour MP for East Hull Karl Turner saying the airline ""failed spectacularly"".

The footage was recorded on October 19 on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted by Kent resident David Lawrence, who uploaded it on to social media.

Mr Turner, who is a qualified barrister and was once Labour's shadow attorney general, tweeted: ""Suspect the pressure to turn this aircraft around quickly and get it airborne meant that they have allowed this alleged offender to remain on the aircraft. He may now get away with it.""

He added: ""@Ryanair failure to deplane the alleged racist offender, handing him over to the Spanish authorities probably means that he isn't now prosecuted.""

He added: ""Unfortunately because @Ryanair is registered in Dublin not in the UK the alleged offence could only be tried by UK authorities if it was 'in flight' to the UK. Section 92(1) Civil Aviation Act s.92(4) defines 'in flight'.

""If this incident had have happened on an alternative airline under 'British Control' or it was already 'in flight' to the UK the prosecuting authorities could have prosecuted.""

Footage shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He replies: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

The man then calls her ""an ugly f****** c***"" and tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: ""if you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat"".

The woman's daughter, 53, told the Huffington Post the row had started because her 77-year-old mother's arthritis meant it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

She said she had taken her mother, who is a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark one year since the death of her father.

""My parents were married over 50 years. She's been feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her spirits.""

She continued: ""I know that if I was behaving like he was or any other black person for that matter, police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight.""

The budget airline tweeted on Sunday that it had seen the footage and reported the incident to Essex police.

It added: ""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

The Dublin-based carrier was hurt in the six months to September 30 by repeated staff strikes which led to flight cancellations. That, coupled with higher fuel costs, contributed to profits falling 7% to €1.2 billion.

The budget airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary warned that margins are under pressure because of fuel reaching $85 per barrel, rising interest rates and a stronger US dollar.

O'Leary pointed to a number of recent collapses, including Danish airline Primera and Cyprus firm Cobalt. He warned: ""It is inevitable that more of the weaker, unhedged European airlines will fold this winter.""

O'Leary added: ""We cannot rule out further capacity cuts or base closures in Ryanair if oil prices rise or air fares fall further.""

He also said the risk of a hard Brexit is rising. In the event of no deal, Ryanair could be forced to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders.

The outspoken's airline chief's gloomy comments come after a difficult year for Ryanair.

It had to grapple with the fallout from a rota fiasco in 2017 that led to pilot shortages and some 20,000 flights being cancelled.

That resulted in Ryanair sweetening contracts and recognising some trade unions.

However, talks with a number of unions are still ongoing, and O'Leary said: ""Repeated air traffic control (ATC) strikes and staff shortages means that 2018 will be the worst year on record for European ATC disruptions.""

The firm still managed to increase revenues 8% to €4.8 billion, which was ahead of what analysts had expected.

Earlier this month, Ryanair issued a profit warning. It today reiterated its full-year profit forecast of between €1.1 billion and €1.2 billion.

The shares edged up 0.52c higher to €11.96.

Ryanair's update today comes days after the airline came under fire for its handling of an incident in which a male passenger allegedly racially abused an elderly black woman aboard one of its Stansted-bound flights last week.

The airline apparently did not remove the passenger from the flight to Barcelona, instead moving the woman from her seat.

The man was filmed by a fellow passenger calling the woman an ""ugly black bastard"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language"" when she spoke to him in English with a Jamaican accent.

UK resident David Lawrence filmed the incident, which happened on 19 October on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted, and shared it on social media, resulting in a barrage of criticism for the airline's handling of the incident.

The video shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats, while her daughter angrily tells him her mother is disabled which is why she is moving slowly.

He can be heard shouting: ""I don't care whether she's fucking disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

The man proceeds to tell staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: ""If you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat.""

In the footage cabin crew appear to be doing little initially to stop the man's tirade, with a passenger in the row behind him telling him to stop the abuse. Then, a cabin crew member can be heard saying to the man ""don't be so rude, you have to calm down"" while other passengers call for the man to be thrown off the flight.

The woman can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash, before asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter.

The woman's 53-year-old daughter told the Huffington Post that they were returning from a holiday designed to cheer her mother up, a year after the death of her father.

The argument started because her mother - a member of the Windrush generation who came to the UK in the 1960s - has arthritis so it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

""I know that if I was behaving like he was or any other black person for that matter, police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight,"" she said.

""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing. As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with,"" she said.

She added that cabin crew denied hearing racist slurs and told her to ring customer services on Monday.

The Labour MP for East Hull and shadow attorney general, Karl Turner, tweeted: ""He should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police. ""We assume the aircraft was in the UK. I fully expect Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight.""

The MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde, Stuart McMillan, tweeted: ""This is really appalling Ryanair. You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.""

Fellow MSP politician Margaret Ferrier said: ""Just watched the shocking footage on a Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed.

The airline had faced a backlash after it chose to move the woman, leaving the unidentified man in his seat.

She told the ITV: ""I feel very low. He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.

""He should have moved and I didn't want to sit there and for him to abuse me anymore.""

She added: ""Why [is] he treating me because the colour of my skin, that's how I look isn't it? Because if I had done that to him I'm sure they would have called the police take away with me.

""Because I know if I do it to him I know everyone on the plane would try to attack me. And because I'm black, I'm sad to say that, they didn't want to get involved with me.""

Ms Gayle said she would not fly with the budget airline again, as she did not feel respected.

David Lawrence filmed the verbal attack and said he chose to do so because he wanted to the world ""to know"" what happened.

The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said he expected more airlines to go bust as the budget carrier posted a 7% drop in profits because of rising fuel prices and strikes hitting costs and bookings.

O'Leary predicted a grim winter for the aviation industry, with oil prices, interest rates and the US dollar rising and fares falling.

He said Ryanair was better hedged than most rivals against the rise in oil prices, adding: ""It is inevitable that more of the weaker, unhedged, European airlines will fold this winter.""

Several smaller airlines have collapsed in recent weeks, including the Cypriot carrier Cobalt last week, the Danish carrier Primera Air and the Swiss airline SkyWork. The UK regional airline Flybe warned of mounting annual losses last week, blaming weaker consumer demand and higher fuel prices.

Ryanair reported a fall in net profits to €1.29bn (£1.1bn) in the six months to 30 September, with its average fare down 3% to less than €46.

The company, Europe's biggest budget airline, already cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12% last month. It has been hit by a wave of strikes by pilots and cabin crew across Europe, which have damaged bookings and pushed up compensation costs. Ryanair said 2018 will also be the worst year on record for European air traffic control strikes.

O'Leary told Bloomberg TV if the UK crashed out of the European Union without a deal next April ""flights would be grounded ... [and] the government would fall"". But while the risk of a hard, no-deal Brexit was rising, he thought it was still unlikely.

Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Airlines are generally facing serious headwinds from a stronger dollar, higher oil prices and rising interest rates - Ryanair is less critically exposed to all of those but the strikes and unionisation are dragging it into the mire.

""The key question is whether management can sort out strikes before customers completely lose faith. The longer strikes go on the more customers shy away from the brand and look elsewhere - hence we are seeing Ryanair slashing prices.""

Ryanair is facing calls for a boycott on Twitter after a racist incident on one of its flights, which it has referred to Essex police.

An airline passenger who filmed a racist incident aboard a Ryanair flight and posted it online said he chose to publicise it to show the world what had happened.

David Lawrence's footage of a man subjecting an elderly women to a tirade of abuse on flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted, filmed on 15 October, has been watched more than 3m times.

The woman moved from her seat, but the man was allowed to remain in his following the incident, which occurred before the flight took off.

Lawrence said it was a difficult decision to film rather than step in to intervene, but he had done so ""because of the power of social media today, and the importance of the public knowing that these incidents take place"".

He said he had been criticised as ""childish"" by one passenger for filming.

Describing himself as a ""child of the Windrush generation"", Lawrence said: ""For many years a lot of the West Indian community have gone through these types of incidents in Britain, but have never been able to share it with the public or with the world. So I decided that I had the opportunity to film this, as difficult as it was,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

The footage shows a man shouting at a woman in his row, telling her to move seats, while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled. The man can be heard saying: ""I don't care whether she's fucking disabled or not - if I tell her to get out, she gets out."" He can be heard in the video calling the woman an ""ugly black bastard"". When the woman remonstrates with him he shouts at her: ""Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow.""

According to the woman's 53-year-old daughter, the argument started because her mother, who was returning from a holiday designed to cheer her up on the one-year anniversary of her husband's death, has arthritis and took some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

Lawrence said he expected more from Ryanair, and he had previously seen people escorted off planes for less. Criticising the lack of response from cabin crew and other passengers, Lawrence said: ""One passenger actually said to me, don't I think it was quite childish me filming the incident.""

The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, described the incident as ""totally unacceptable"" and told the Today programme he hoped ""police would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case"".

However, shadow transport minister Karl Turner said he understood that Ryanair's failure to immediately remove the man from the flight and hand him over to the Spanish authorities could result in no charges being brought.

Because Ryanair is registered in Dublin and the plane was on the ground in Spain, UK law did not apply, Turner told BBC Radio 4's World at One. There was no extradition arrangement for an offence of this nature, he said, so there might be no charges unless the man handed himself over to the Spanish authorities. ""I doubt whether he's going to do that,"" Turner said.

He added: ""I think Ryanair has failed spectacularly, because it should have been dealt with, it should have been handed over to the Spanish authorities, not least because he's committed really grotesque criminal offences.""

Ryanair tweeted on Sunday that it had reported the matter to Essex police. ""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

Theresa May's official spokesman declined to comment on the case, but told reporters: ""When people are travelling and going about their public life, no one should be subjected to intimidation or any form of abuse.""

The woman, 53, told the Huffington Post the row had started because her 77-year-old mother's arthritis meant it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

The daughter said she had taken her mother, who is a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark one year since the death of her father.

The woman said that when she had complained to cabin crew they denied hearing any racial slurs and they told her to ring customer services on Monday.

News of the incident was retweeted 18,000 times after a user with the handle @StanceGrounded uploaded Mr Laurence's clip, prompting widespread condemnation of Ryanair for failing to act swiftly.

A number of politicians voiced their concern at Ryanair's apparent lack of action.

Labour MP for East Hull and shadow Attorney General Karl Turner tweeted: ""He should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police.

""We assume the aircraft was in the UK. If it was he definitely committed criminal offences. I fully expect @Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight.""

MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: ""This is really appalling @Ryanair . You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.""

Fellow MSP politician Margaret Ferrier said: ""Just watched the shocking footage on a @Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed.

""Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately. However well done to passenger with black t-shirt that intervened £hero.""

A man who filmed a racist incident on board a Ryanair flight has defended his actions claiming that he filmed the incident to let the world know what happened.

David Lawrence filmed the moment a man racially abused an elderly black woman on a flight from Barcelona to London Gatwick on October 19.

The airline has faced a backlash after it moved the woman and allegedly left the man in his seat.

Mr Lawrence said he chose to film the incident as ""now the world knows"" what happened.

Footage of the incident posted to his Facebook account has been viewed some 4.5 million times.

He told BBC Breakfast: ""I had to make a difficult decision at the time because if I had stepped in I don't think you would have seen the footage that I captured.""

The video shows a man shouting at a woman telling her to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He said: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

Mr Lawrence says he was not confronted by any other passengers.

He added: ""In fact, one of the passengers whilst I was filming basically said to me don't you think you're being a bit childish by filming this.""

Ally Murphy, a former cabin crew supervisor who also appeared on the show, said Mr Lawrence made the right call in deciding to film the incident.

""It is great that David did film that,"" she said. ""This happens every day in the community and people need to step forward and say this isn't right.""

""But as a cabin crew member it is not great when people pile in and try to take things into their own hands,"" she added.

Ryanair tweeted on Sunday that they had reported the incident to Essex Police.

It added: ""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

56,[],"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair reported a 7 percent fall in profit during its key April-September season on Monday, citing higher fuel costs and damage to bookings caused by strikes, and said European short-haul airfares would remain soft this winter.

Ryanair three weeks ago cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent and warned that worse may follow if a recent wave of pilot and cabin crew strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.

Europe's largest low-cost carrier has struggled with labour relations since it bowed to pressure to recognise trade unions for the first time last December. It said it hoped to finalise more union agreements in the coming months but could not rule out further industrial action.

Shares of Ryanair, which is also counting the cost of stubbornly high fuel prices, closed on Friday at 11.51 euros, down 20 percent compared to three months ago and down 40 percent from a peak of 19.39 euros in August last year before its staff problems emerged.

Ryanair, which traditionally makes most of its profit in the summer, reported a profit of 1.2 billion euros (1.1 billion pounds) in the six months to Sept. 30. It reiterated its full-year profit forecast of between 1.1 billion euros and 1.2 billion euros.

That would represent a 17-24 percent fall from the record 1.45 billion euro post-tax profit booked in its most recent financial year to March 31.

A poll of over 10 analysts by Ryanair ahead of the results found an average forecast of 1.127 billion euros for the full year and 1.175 billion for the six months to Sept. 30.

""This full year guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further - they remain soft this winter due to excess capacity in Europe - (and) the impact of significantly higher oil prices on our unhedged exposures,"" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

But he said Ryanair's cost advantage over rivals is widening and ""over the medium term, consolidation will create growth opportunities for Ryanair's lowest fare/lowest cost model.""

57,[],"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair said on Monday it hopes to conclude its remaining labour issues by Christmas, signalling a possible end to damaging flight disruptions which have dragged on its shares.

The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, also said it may have to cut its capacity further this winter due to high oil costs and intense competition, although these factors were helping it to resolve its difficult industrial relations.

""Given the adverse environment that's out there for airlines and the number of job losses being reported in recent weeks both by pilots and cabin crew, there is a much more sensible, common sense approach being taken by the unions,"" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation.

Ryanair shares rose by 3.7 percent at 0755 GMT, despite it reporting a 7 percent fall in profit during its key April-September season due to high fuel costs, excess capacity and damage to bookings caused by a wave of strikes.

That was better than the 9 percent fall forecast by a poll of analysts in the wake of an Oct. 1 profit warning.

Over-capacity is likely to continue to weigh on average fares in the winter unless there is a major failure of a rival, but the failure of several small airlines in recent weeks is concentrating the minds of staff, O'Leary said.

Ryanair only needs to secure agreement with two major unions, in Belgium and Germany and is ""hopeful of concluding agreements with them this side of Christmas"", he added.

The airline, which has in the past threatened cuts to growth during negotiations with unions, has struggled with labour relations since it bowed to pressure to recognise trade unions for the first time last December.

Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent three weeks ago and warned that worse may follow if a recent wave of pilot and cabin crew strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.

OIL IMPACT

Increases in the oil price or further falls in fares could force Ryanair to add to the 1 percent cut in capacity announced alongside a profit warning on Oct. 1.

""If oil remains at or above $85 (65.1 pounds) a barrel and fares are under pressure then it would probably be the sensible thing to do to take a look at capacity,"" Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorohan said.

Ryanair, which makes most of its profit in the summer, reported a profit of 1.2 billion euros (1.1 billion pounds) in the six months to Sept. 30. It reiterated its full-year profit forecast of between 1.1 billion euros and 1.2 billion euros.

58,[],"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair hopes to reach deals with all of its major unions by Christmas, its chief executive said on Monday, in a sign an end may be in sight to disruptions which have hit its profit and shares.

The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, on Monday reported a 7 percent fall in profits in the six months to Sept. 30 on high fuel costs and intense competition.

But it said these factors were helping it to resolve its industrial relations troubles.

""Given the adverse environment that's out there for airlines and the number of job losses being reported in recent weeks both by pilots and cabin crew, there is a much more sensible, common sense approach being taken by the unions,"" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation.

O'Leary said that recent progress in talks left Germany and Belgium as the only two large markets for the airline where recognition agreements had not been secured.

""We would be hopeful of concluding agreements with them this side of Christmas,"" he added.

The fall in profit was less than the 9 percent drop forecast by analysts and Ryanair shares were 4.2 percent higher at 12.00 euros at 1100 GMT.

Ryanair's shares are almost 40 percent down from a peak of 19.39 euros in August last year before the industrial relations issues began.

A staff revolt forced management to recognise unions for the first time last December and the airline has since struggled to put in place union recognition agreements.

A spokesman for Belgium's LBC-NVK union said it was waiting for an offer from Ryanair on Thursday and had warned the airline they could strike again if there is no progress.

A spokesman for German unions VC said he saw ""no real progress"" in talks with Ryanair, which also needs to secure recognition deals in the Netherlands and Sweden.

On Friday it said it had reached agreement with British, Portuguese and Italian pilots and was close to a deal with Spanish pilots, although the British union said the deal had not been approved by its members yet.

Ryanair issued a profit warning on Oct. 1 citing damage to bookings from strikes and cutting its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent.

But on Monday, O'Leary said much of the weakness of recent weeks was sector-wide rather than specific to Ryanair.

Over-capacity in European short-haul will push Ryanair fares down by 2 percent in the six months to March 31 compared to the same period last year, O'Leary forecast. He warned he would not rule out a 3 percent fall.

""We are entering into a grim winter in terms of declining air fares,"" he told an analyst conference call. ""But moving into the summer of 2019 I would expect to see some upward traction on pricing... following oil prices with a 12-month lag.""

Ryanair, which makes most of its profit in the summer, reported a profit of 1.2 billion euros ($1.38 billion) in the six months to Sept. 30, better than the 1.127 billion euros forecast in a company poll of more than 10 analysts.

Footage of a man making racist remarks to an elderly black woman on a flight from Barcelona to London on Friday went viral over the weekend.

The Fórsa trade union which represents Irish-based pilots and cabin crew has said the man should have been removed from the aircraft.

A spokesperson for the Union said it was clear from the video that the behaviour was unacceptable and that the man should not have been allowed to fly because of the risk to the health and safety of crew and other passengers if his behaviour escalated.

He said it was important for Ryanair to have clear protocols to remove people from the cabin if they pose such a risk.

77-year-old widow Deslie Gayle told ITV News of her upset over the incident.

However Ryanair has said it could not comment on the incident as it has been referred to police in Essex.

The Immigrant Council of Ireland says the incident is an example of why hate-crime legislation is required.

Pippa Woolnaugh said staff also need the training to deal with these incidents which she said have high occurrences on public transport.

The image went viral on social media.

Four Ryanair planes had been diverted due to Storm Leslie in Portugal, where they are based.

Initially, there was an apology from a member of the airline's management team.

In a tweet, Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew apologised to the staff, saying there were no hotel rooms available on the night in Malaga.

But on Wednesday, Ryanair posted CCTV footage on Twitter, which the airline said showed that the staff involved had staged the photo.

Following the incident, a number of Ryanair employees have been asked to attend a meeting at the airline's headquarters in Dublin this week.

Delsie Gayle, 77, will now be able to give police a statement about what happened, her daughter said.

Footage of the reported incident was captured by a fellow passenger on Ryanair flight FR015 at Barcelona Airport on 19 October, before it left for London Stansted.

Today, Essex Police said they had been contacted on Sunday about ""a racially-aggravated incident happening on a Ryanair plane while on the tarmac at Barcelona Airport"".

""Since the report was made to us our officers have identified both parties involved and are progressing a number of enquiries,"" the force said.

""There are agreed national protocols to follow when incidents are reported to have happened in another country.""

""As such, we will be conducting an investigation to submit to the Spanish authorities in due course.""

Ryanair has said it cannot comment on the incident as it has been referred to police.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning programme today, Mrs Gayle's daughter Carol said police had advised her that ""by Thursday they should be coming to mum for a statement"".

Mrs Gayle said she was scared by the man's behaviour on the plane.

She said: ""I travel a lot, and I have never had this kind of reaction.

""I go to Canada, I go to Jamaica and never.""

Mrs Gayle's daughter had arranged the trip in an attempt to cheer her mother up one year after she was widowed.

She said: ""It's coming up to a year of my dad's death, so I thought I'd take my mum away just for a little mini-break.

The family of an elderly black woman who was racially abused on a Ryanair flight have told HuffPost UK they are ""surprised, disgusted and hurt"" that they have still had no contact from the airline, despite the Transport Secretary suggesting what occurred on board was a crime.

Windrush generation migrant Mrs Gayle, 77, was returning from a holiday to mark the anniversary of her husband's death with her daughter, when the incident occurred just before their flight took off.

In a shocking video captured by fellow passenger David Lawrence, a man can be heard referring to the pensioner as an ""ugly black bastard"". He appears to be refusing to sit next to her and threatening to ""push"" her if she does not sit elsewhere.

Following a brief and heated argument between the man, Mrs Gayle and her daughter, the elderly woman is moved elsewhere on the aircraft while the man remains in the same seat. Cabin crew seen in the video appear to take no action against the man.

The incident has prompted widespread criticism and outrage, with many people questioning why the man was not removed from aircraft and reported to the police.

The Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday: ""What we saw was totally unacceptable. The fact is that race abuse of that kind is a crime. And if a crime is committed it should be dealt with appropriately.

""So therefore I would hope that notwithstanding what took place on that day, that the police would want to take action in such an extraordinarily unacceptable case.""

Under article 7 of Ryanair's terms and conditions, the airline may refuse carriage if a passenger's ""mental or physical state or attitude, behaviour or demeanour presents a hazard or risk to yourself, to passengers, to crew, or to property.""

Ryanair tweeted on Sunday morning: ""We are aware of this video and have reported this matter to Essex Police.""

However, the carrier said that higher fuel, staff and higher passenger compensation costs as a result of cancelled flights were offset by strong ancillary revenue growth during the six months to the end of September, the company said in a statement on Monday.

Passenger numbers rose by 6 per cent during the period to 76.6, while revenues increased by 8 per cent to € 4.79 billion.

Ryanair warned three weeks' ago that its full-year profit forecast by 12 per cent to between €1.1 billion and €1.2 billion, as fears of strikes hit forward bookings from customers, while rising oil prices also took their toll.

""Our full year guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further (they remain soft this winter due to excess capacity in Europe, the impact of significantly higher oil prices and on our unhedged exposures, the absence of unforeseen security events, ATC (air traffic controller) and other strikes and the impact of negative Brexit developments,"" Ryanair said on Monday.

Chief executive Michael O'Leary said at the time of the profit warning that while the carrier had ""successfully managed"" five strikes by a quarter of its Irish pilots during the summer, two co-ordinated strikes in September by cabin crew and pilots in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Portugal had hit bookings and forward air fares, especially for the October school mid-terms and Christmas periods

He was sat next to a woman and he launched into a racist tirade, calling her an 'ugly black b******' and shouted 'don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow.'

People were furious with Ryanair when the video surfaced online and hit out at the airline for not removing the man from the flight, instead making the woman move to another seat.

Labour MP for East Hull Karl Turner said the airline has 'failed spectacularly' after he viewed the video.

Mr Turner, who is a qualified barrister and was once Labour's shadow attorney general, tweeted: 'Suspect the pressure to turn this aircraft around quickly and get it airborne meant that they have allowed this alleged offender to remain on the aircraft.

'He may now get away with it.'

The MP continued: '@Ryanair failure to deplane the alleged racist offender, handing him over to the Spanish authorities probably means that he isn't now prosecuted.'

He added: 'Unfortunately because @Ryanair is registered in Dublin not in the UK the alleged offence could only be tried by UK authorities if it was ""in flight"" to the UK. Section 92(1) Civil Aviation Act s.92(4) defines ""in flight"".

Essex Police confirmed the man at the root of the Ryanair row had been identified and have given information on 'both parties' to the Spanish authorities, who are helping the investigation.

They said: 'We have worked to identify both parties involved in this incident and passed this information to the Spanish authorities, who are leading on this investigation.

'Our officers will continue to provide assistance where necessary throughout the course of this case.'

The news comes after Deslie spoke out about the racial abuse she received on the flight.

Speaking to ITV News, she fought back tears as she said: 'I was shocked, nobody ever said those words to me. I feel very low.

'He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.

'He should have moved and I didn't want to sit there and for him to abuse me anymore. It made me feel really angry.'

Mrs Gayle said her sadness is made worse by the fact that she is mourning her husband, who died one year ago.

The man who filmed a Ryanair passenger racially abusing an elderly black woman has claimed he was called ""childish"" for filming the incident which has caused a furious backlash online.

David Lawrence filmed the shocking incident on a Ryanair flight between Barcelona and Stansted on 19 October and subsequently posted the footage online where it has since gone viral.

Mr Lawrence, who said he is the son of Windrush generation immigrants to the UK, said he took the difficult decision to film the incident in order to show the world, but said he was called childish for doing so by other passengers.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the reaction to the video showed: ""The power of social media today and the importance of the public knowing that these incidents take place.

""For many years, a lot of the West Indian community has gone through a lot of these types of incidents in Britain, but have never been able to share it, with the public or with the world and so I decided that I had the opportunity to film this, as difficult as it was.""

Kicked off the plane

The video, which had been viewed 4.5 million times by Monday morning, shows an elderly white man racially abusing and threatening to push an elderly black woman from her seat. The woman is then asked if she would like to move, and the man is left in his seat.

Mr Lawrence criticised passengers and Ryanair for their response to the incident, saying that the man should have been kicked off the plane.

""If you watch the footage you'll see that there was no response from anyone. That young man, a credit to him, he tried to step in. But yet as you can see, the man in question wasn't having any of it.

""You can see very clearly that he knew exactly what he wanted to do, he knew exactly what he was saying and refused to take any advice from anyone.""

'Quite a show'

He said that he believed the reaction would have been different if a black man had been abusing an elderly disabled white lady.

""Instead, you can see from the footage passengers smiling, giggling, it's quite a show and one passenger said to me, [didn't] I think it was quite childish me filming the incident.

""We hadn't taken off yet, so we were still grounded when this was going on. What have I seen in the past? I've seen airlines ground to a halt and police called and passengers escorted off of planes for less.

""That was what I was actually waiting for, for the police to arrive, whether they had been Spanish police or whoever and escort this man off and then take care of the 77-year old lady.""

Unruly behaviour

Ryanair said the incident had been reported to Essex Police. It told the BBC: ""We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this.

""We will be taking this matter further and disruptive or abusive behaviour like this will result in passengers being banned from travel.""

Essex Police told i in a statement: ""This incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport.

""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation.""

The incident has provoked a major backlash with MP David Lammy calling for a boycott of Ryanair.

The daughter of the woman who was targeted said she believed if a black person had behaved in the same way they would have been thrown off the flight immediately.

The woman, 53, told the Huffington Post the row had started because her 77-year-old mother's arthritis meant it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

The daughter said she had taken her mother, who is a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark one year since the death of her father.

""My parents were married over 50 years. She's been feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her spirits.

He reacted in horror as widow Delcie Gayle revealed how she was unable to eat or sleep after she was targeted by a fellow passenger on a flight from Barcelona to London Stansted.

The 77-year-old, who was called an 'ugly black b**tard' was told 'don't speak to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow'.

Appearing on This Morning with her daughter Carol, she was reduced to tears as she explained the details behind the attack.

The situation on board the flight unfolded after a man demanded Delcie move out of her seat so he could sit in the window seat.

Unfortunately, her attempt to comply was halted as the man shouted: 'Don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid cow,' before demanding the flight attendants 'get this ugly black b*****d away' from him.

Struggling to contain his anger at how the Irish airline handled the situation, presenter Holmes hit out, saying: 'As usual [Ryanair] have a reputation of treating your passengers with complete contempt.'

In footage filmed by another passenger on October 19 on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted, a flight attendant could be seen warning the man: 'Don't tell me what to do and don't you dare shout at her.'

Growing angry on her behalf, Holmes said: 'You're a kind caring woman [Delcie] as we can tell from your job, from the profession you had [as a care assistant].

'If I'd been cabin crew I immediately would have looked at this lady and thought, 'Let me take her away let me swap someone in that seat -- let me take her far away on the other side.'

Essex Police said it had 'worked to identify both parties involved in this incident', adding that the information had passed to the Spanish authorities who are heading the investigation.

Mrs Gayle told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamon Holmes said she was scared by the man's behaviour on the plane, adding: 'He was shouting -- he went over and he said to the assistant 'get this ugly black b***ard away from me'. I didn't say anything.'

She said he threatened to continue verbally abusing her, telling staff: 'I do what I want to do. If you don't move her, I'll carry on'. I was so frightened.'

Mrs Gayle added: 'I travel a lot, and I have never had this kind of reaction. I go to Canada, I go to Jamaica and never.'

Mrs Gayle's daughter had arranged the trip in an attempt to cheer her mother up a year after she was widowed.

An elderly black woman who was racially abused by a fellow passenger on a Ryanair flight is a Windrush generation migrant who was returning from a holiday to mark the anniversary of her husband's death, her daughter has told HuffPost UK.

The woman's daughter says she will never fly Ryanair again, and she believes that if it had been a black person behaving in that way ""police would have been called and we would have been kicked off of the flight.""

In the shocking video, captured by fellow passenger David Lawrence, a man can be heard referring to Mrs Gayle, a 77-year-old pensioner from East London, as an ""ugly black bastard"". He appears to be refusing to sit next to her and threatening to ""push"" her if she does not sit elsewhere.

The video begins with a noisy row over seating, in which Mrs Gayle's daughter can be seen arguing loudly with the man. Moments later, when the elderly woman speaks with a Jamaican accent, the man replies ""don't talk to me in a fucking foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow.""

Eventually, Mrs Gayle is seen asking to be moved, while the man remains in his seat. He can then be heard telling the flight attendant, ""I'm alright, now she's gone."" Passengers can be seen intervening, with one asking for the elderly man to be taken off the flight.

Ryanair suffered a dip in pre-tax profits over the last financial half brought on by rising fuel costs and compensation payouts for delayed and cancelled flights.

The beleaguered airline saw a 9% fall in the six months up to September 30, to €1.3 billion (£1.1bn).

The firm was forced to issue a profit warning at the start of the month, in which it announced its full year profits were expected to fall 12%.

The latest report shows overall revenue rose 8% to £4.2bn.

Average fares fell 3% triggered by excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in the first quarter, staff shortages and cancellations of weekend flights which tend to be higher cost.

Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: ""As recently guided, first half average fares fell by 3%. While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27%, these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 (compensation) costs.

""Our traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of ATC (air traffic control) disruptions on record, grew 6% at an unchanged 96% load factor.""

""We have trimmed winter capacity by 1% (including base closures in Eindhoven and Bremen) in response to weaker fares and higher oil prices.""

Ryanair said it now expects annual traffic growth of 6% to 138 million passengers - slightly down on previous guidance of 139 million - following a 1% reduction in winter capacity.

The airline's fuel bill is expected to come in about €460m (£496m) higher year-on-year.

It follows a year of chaos in which passengers have repeatedly been left stranded following delayed and cancelled flights throughout Europe as pilots and cabin crew embarked on strikes.

The disruptions aren't the only concern on the airline's mind as it expressed hopes that a transition period after Brexit will be extended.

O'Leary added: ""The risk of a hard (""no-deal"") Brexit in March 2019 is rising. While we hope that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), we remain concerned that the time to complete such an agreement is shortening.""

It comes as the airline was hit with another scandal over the weekend in which an elderly black woman was racially abused by another passenger on a flight from Barcelona to London Stansted.

The woman's family exclusively told HuffPost UK that Mrs Gayle, a 77-year-old immigrant of the Windrush generation, has still not received an apology from the airline three days after the incident.

Delsie Gayle was on board her flight to London, after a holiday in Spain, when a male passenger refused to sit by her and called her an ""ugly black bastard"".

""Don't speak to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow,"" he was heard saying in the footage, which went viral after it was posted online.

Mrs Gayle, a 77-year-old member of the Windrush generation, said the incident had left her feeling ""really depressed"".

The language used by the male passenger had ""shocked"" her. ""Nobody ever said those words to me,"" said Mrs Gayle, from east London.

""I haven't done anything to attack him. It's because of the colour of my skin I was abused like that,"" she told ITV News.

""I feel very low. He paid a fare to go on holiday, I've paid mine so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin?

""He do it with me and he gets away, he'll do it to somebody else.""

Mrs Gayle, who is disabled, said she was unwilling to use Ryanair ever again.

Her daughter added: ""Nothing was done and I know if that was a black person racially abusing an elderly woman the police would have been called. When I saw the video I felt he was the victim - that's the way RyanAir was treating it.""

Mrs Gayle said she had not been contacted by Ryanair but in a statement given to i, the airline said: ""Our customer care team contacted the Gayle family on Sunday (21 October). As this is now a police matter we cannot comment further.""

The footage was filmed by David Lawrence, who had also been travelling back to London on the flight. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme he wanted to show the world what had happened.

Speaking on a call with analysts after Ryanair posted a 7 per cent slump in first-half profits to €1.2 billion, group chief executive Michael O'Leary said that ""it's appropriate"" to wait for some clarity on the UK's exit from the European Union before buying back more shares. Ryanair spent €750 million acquiring its own stock between February and early October as its market value fell.

""The risks of a no-deal or hard Brexit have risen materially,"" Mr O'Leary said. ""Although on balance, we still expect that the UK will stumble into transition at the end of March. That transition period will last at least 21 months out to December 2020 and probably be extended thereafter.""

The first-half profit drop came as strikes hit bookings, rising oil prices rose, and Ryanair's average fares fell by 3 per cent during the period as European airlines grappled with ""excess capacity"". Fares are expected to ease by a further 2 per cent during the second half of Ryanair's financial year, the company said.

However, the carrier said that higher fuel, staff and higher passenger compensation costs as a result of cancelled flights were offset by a 27 per surge in first-half ancillary revenue, to €1.3 billion.

Passenger numbers rose by 6 per cent during the period to 76.6 million, while revenues increased by 8 per cent to €4.79 billion.

Ryanair warned three weeks' ago that its full-year profit forecast by 12 per cent to between €1.1 billion and €1.2 billion, as fears of strikes hit forward bookings from customers, while rising oil prices also took their toll.

""Our full year guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further (they remain soft this winter due to excess capacity in Europe, the impact of significantly higher oil prices and on our unhedged exposures, the absence of unforeseen security events, ATC (air traffic controller) and other strikes and the impact of negative Brexit developments,"" Ryanair said on Monday.

Mr O'Leary said at the time of the profit warning that while the carrier had ""successfully managed"" five strikes by a quarter of its Irish pilots during the summer, two co-ordinated strikes in September by cabin crew and pilots in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Portugal had hit bookings and forward air fares, especially for the October school mid-terms and Christmas periods

Carriers, including Ryanair, also had to contend with what Mr O'Leary called the ""worst summer of ATC disruptions on record"" during the first half of its financial year.

Since Ryanair's unprecedented step last December to agree to recognise labour unions, the company has reached recognition agreements with pilot and cabin crew organisations in Ireland, Italy, the UK, as well as accords last week with German cabin crew and Portuguese pilots.

""Progress has been slower in other markets such as Spain and Portugal (cabin crew) and Germany (pilots) where competitor employees have interfered to delay agreements with our people and their unions,"" it said. ""While we hope to finalise more union agreements in the coming months, we cannot rule out occasional industrial action, but we expect their impact to be very limited.""

The company's €1.2 billion first-half profit and full-year guidance exclude losses at Laudamotion, the low-cost Austrian airline in which it recently acquired a 75 per cent stake.

""Despite a difficult first summer, Laudamotion will carry almost 3 million guests this year but will loss approximately €150 million in start-up year one exceptional costs,"" Ryanair said. ""We are assisting them to improve cost control, fuel hedging and fleet management.""

Ryanair said that with airline margins under pressure in Europe oil prices and the value of the dollar rise, ""it is inevitable that more of the weaker, unhedged, European airlines will fold this winter"".

The company said that 90 per cent of its own fuel needs are hedged at $68 dollars per barrel, below the current market price of about $80.

An anti-racism campaigner has condemned Ryanair's reaction to an abusive passenger on a plane, saying the airline should apologise as a ""minimum"".

A passenger was filmed verbally abusing a woman sat next to him, calling her an ""ugly black b*****d"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow"".

Other passengers tried to intervene and the woman was eventually moved, but the man was not removed from the flight.

""I think that was a disgusting incident, the man's a bully and a coward,"" Weyman Bennett, co-convenor of Stand Up To Racism, told Mike Graham on talkRADIO's breakfast show.

""What surprised me is that Ryanair did not remove the man, and removed the woman who was the subject of the abuse and made her sit somewhere else.""

He said the airline, which has tweeted that they reported the incident to the police, should suffer the financial hit of a boycott.

""I've heard David Lammy has called for people to boycott Ryanair, and they should pay the financial penalty for their behaviour,"" he said.

MP Karl Turner tweeted that, because of the complexities of aviation law and the fact the incident did not happen 'in flight', it may not be possible to prosecute the man.

""The idea that the man gets away with it scot-free, I find difficult to stomach,"" said Bennett.

""I've been on planes where people have been removed for less. They can't hide behind the veil of 'we didn't know what to do'. The minimum should be an apology.""

Bennett also said he thought there was an increase in prejudice in the world.

""Why does he feel entitled and empowered to carry out such a hostile act? One of the problems we're facing in the 21st century is a rise of bigotry and racism,"" he said.

Graham asked whether bigotry had always been there, but had become more noticeable due to social media.

""Sadly I don't think that's the case,"" Bennett replied

""When people like Donald Trump make racist statements they pollute the body politic. Recently there's been an increase in hostility, and we don't want to make the same mistakes as previous generations, in terms of antisemitism... I think there's a particular bigotry towards Muslims.

DURING A PERIOD when Ryanair was ""rife with strikes"", profits at the no-frills airline dipped by €90 million.

Financials released that cover the first half of the year show that the firm's profits dropped by 7% to €1.2 billion compared to 2017.

The airline carried 76.6 million passengers during the six months to 30 September, an increase of 4.5 million compared to the previous period in 2017. Revenue was up 8% to €4.79 billion.

Ryanair's average fare declined by 3% due to excess capacity in Europe and an earlier than usual Easter period. The decline in profits was also put down to strikes by air traffic control (ATC) workers.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary claimed it has been ""the worst year on record for ATC services"" and blamed the airline's dip in on-time performance from 86% to 75% on ATC strikes.

In recent months, the airline has also been hit by strike action by its own workers. Last month, Ryanair faced the biggest industrial action in the company's history as members from five European countries threatened to go on strike.

Following the presentation of the financial results, Ryanair chief financial officer Neil Sorahan defended the company's position after one shareholder referenced media reports that the company was ""rife with strikes"".

""You can't believe everything you read in the papers,"" said Sorahan. ""We've had a limited number of strike days over the summer period and we've handled the operation phenomenally well on the days of strikes with limited disruption.""

He added that the airline has operated over 90% of its flights on schedule in the impacted markets and faced ""minimum disruption"".

O'Leary also weighed in to downplay the scale of the industrial action faced by the airline.

""It's important to put that in some context. We've had eight days over this year, which is less than Lufthansa has had in the last two years and than Air France has in the current year. In any of those days, we continue to operate more than 95% of the total schedule across Europe.""

Unions

Earlier this month, O'Leary said that repeated strike action in some of the company's key markets has spooked passengers from booking tickets with the airline. As a result, Ryanair lowered its full-year profit guidance by 12% to a new range of €1.1 billion - €1.2 billion.

Ryanair agreed to recognise unions at the end of last year and has been stuck in numerous battles with groups representing workers in recent months.

Earlier this year, an Irish union representing pilots that was in talks with Ryanair pushed for proposed bogus self-employment laws to specifically target the low-cost carrier's hiring practices.

On continental Europe, the airline said it has ""regrettably"" been impeded in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Holland and Belgium in union negotiations.

O'Leary said Ryanair has made ""very significant progress"" in negotiations with unions and has agreements signed with pilots and cabin crew in Ireland, UK and Italy.

He added that pilots in Portugal signed a deal last week, while the agreement with Spanish pilots would be signed within ""the next week or two"".

There is still no agreement in place with workers in large markets such as Germany and Belgium, but O'Leary said that deals could be concluded ""this side of Christmas"".

He added that the airline could not rule out further strike action in the coming months.

""There is a risk (of more strikes). We don't expect strikes in the coming weeks, but they can't be ruled out. It's not within our control.""

Elsewhere in the financial report, it was noted that Ryanair increased its stake in Laudamotion to 75% in August.

The new Austrian airline, founded by ex-Formula 1 racer Niki Lauda, faced a difficult first summer and it has been predicted the firm will lose approx €150 million during its first year. However, the firm is expected to move towards break even in its second year.

The report also showed that investment by Ryanair in its tech division largely drove the increase in total revenue due to improved conversion of priority boarding sales.

A man who filmed a viral 'racist' incident on a Ryanair flight said he chose not to intervene so that he could publicise what happened.

David Lawrence filmed a man verbally abusing a fellow passenger, calling her an ""ugly black b*****d, whilst other passengers tried to intervene.

The woman was eventually moved, but the man was not removed from the flight.

Mr Lawrence said that because of him filming, ""now the world knows"" what happened.

He told BBC Breakfast: ""I had to make a difficult decision at that time because if I had stepped in I don't think you would have seen the footage that I captured.""

Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman declined to comment on the specific case, but told reporters: ""When people are travelling and going about their public life, no-one should be subjected to intimidation or any form of abuse.

""The Prime Minister has always been clear that racial abuse is abhorrent.

""In relation to this particular case, there's obviously an investigation being conducted by Essex Police and it's right that I don't comment specifically on that.""

The video, recorded on October 19 on flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted before the plane had taken off, shows a man shouting at a woman telling her to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He said: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

In the video the man can be heard calling the elderly woman an ""ugly black b******"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow"".

Weyman Bennett, co-convenor of Stand Up To Racism and Unite Against Fascism, told Mike Graham on talkRADIO's breakfast show: ""I think that was a disgusting incident, the man's a bully and a coward.

""What surprised me is that Ryanair did not remove the man, and removed the woman who was the subject of the abuse and made her sit somewhere else.""

Mr Bennett added: ""The idea that the man gets away with it scot-free, I find difficult to stomach.

""I've been on planes where people have been removed for less. They can't hide behind the veil of 'we didn't know what to do'. The minimum should be an apology.""

Ryanair tweeted on Sunday that they had reported the incident to Essex Police.

It added: ""As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

A spokeswoman for Essex police said on Sunday: ""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported.

BRIT cops probing a vile racist rant on board a Ryanair flight have finally identified a suspect - with Spanish cops now helping the investigation.

Essex Police came under fire for making no arrests after Delsie Gayle, 77, was branded an ""ugly black b******"" on the flight from Barcelona to Stansted.

They confirmed today a suspect had been identified and have given the information on ""both parties"" to Spanish authorities.

Widow Delsie fought back tears as she described the shocking race rant, which took place on Friday.

She told ITV: ""I feel very low. He paid a fare to go on holiday, I've paid mine so why does he abuse me for that due to the colour of my skin?""

The Windrush generation migrant had been on her way home to London Stansted from a trip to Barcelona on Friday when she was abused.

Delsie Gayle said she was shocked at the abuse she received

She said she hadn't been able to eat or sleep after being targeted in the sickening tirade.

And Delsie said she was frustrated with the reaction by Ryanair staff, saying: ""He do it with me and he gets away, he'll do it to somebody else.""

In the video, the bully demands the pensioner move before calling her an ""ugly, black b******.""

Delsie's daughter has vowed never to fly with the budget airline again after the plane staff demanded her elderly mum move seats, instead of the man responsible.

Crew members could be seen moving the elderly widow to another seat as the man continues his disgusting rant.

Her daughter, 53, told the Huffington Post: ""In a few weeks, it'll be one year since my dad died and I took my mum away for a few days' break.

""She's been feeling really down and depressed, so I thought the trip would raise her spirits.

""The underlying reason behind the man's abusive behaviour comes down to the fact that my mum is a black woman and he didn't want her sitting next to him.""

Delsie was a Windrush Generation migrant who moved to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s .

Her daughter is now demanding her mother get an apology.

She added: ""I know that if I was behaving like he was or any other black person, for that matter, police would've been called and we would've been kicked off of the flight.

""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief that she's already experiencing.

""We will never fly with Ryanair again.""

The family have complained, but says Ryanair staff denied hearing racial slurs.

Ryanair has commented on the incident, saying: ""We are aware of this video and have reported this matter to Essex Police.""

Jeremy Vine is among the celebs calling for action.

He tweeted: ""If this is Ryanair, they need to explain how this man's disgusting racial abuse of the black lady in the seat next to him ends up with HER being asked to move. It is beyond belief.""

Tens of thousands of people have viewed the row on flight FR9015 on Friday afternoon.

Twitter users yesterday slammed Essex Police for not arresting anyone following the racist tirade.

One user fumed: ""Why isn't the useless @EssexPoliceUK bothered to arrest him?""

Mrs Gayle's daughter tried to explain to the man that her mother is disabled, but he continued his rant.

He told her: 'I don't care whether she's f**king disabled or not. If I tell her to get out she gets out.'

Speaking on ITV news, Mrs Gayle explained that the experience has left her in a terrible place.

She explained: 'I was shocked, nobody ever said those words to me. I feel very low.

'He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.

'He should have moved and I didn't want to sit there and for him to abuse me anymore. It made me feel really angry.'

Mrs Gayle said her sadness is made worse by the fact that she is mourning her husband, who died one year ago.

There has been a significant backlash at how the situation was handled by in-flight staff, as many suggested that the man should have been removed from the plane immediately.

91,[],"Ryanair has reported to UK police an incident on a plane in which a passenger was filmed shouting racial abuse to a woman in the seat next to him.

The airline had been criticised for apparently failing to remove the man from the plane, who was filmed by a fellow passenger calling the elderly woman an ""ugly black bastard"", and shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow"".

In a statement, released on Monday Ryanair said:

""We have reported this to the police in Essex and as this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

The footage was recorded on Friday on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted by UK resident David Lawrence who uploaded it on to social media. It shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He replies: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not -- if I tell her to get out she gets out.""

The man then calls her ""an ugly f****** c***"" and tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: ""if you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat"".

Staff on the flight seemed to do little to silence the man during the footage, leaving a passenger in the row behind to try and deal with the situation.

The cabin crew can be heard to say: ""Don't be so rude, you have to calm down"" while other passengers call for the man to be thrown off the flight.

The victim can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash, before asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter.

The row apparently broke out after the elderly woman was unable to move out of her aisle seat quickly enough to let the man sit down in his window seat.

The incident was retweeted thousands of times after Twitter user @StanceGrounded uploaded Mr Laurence's clip, prompting widespread condemnation of Ryanair for failing to act swiftly.

A number of politicians voiced their concern at Ryanair's apparent lack of action.

Labour MP for East Hull and shadow attorney general Karl Turner tweeted: ""He should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police.

""We assume the aircraft was in the UK. If it was he definitely committed criminal offences. I fully expect Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight.""

MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: ""This is really appalling Ryanair . You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.""

Fellow MSP politician Margaret Ferrier said: ""Just watched the shocking footage on a Ryanair aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male passenger should have been put off flight before it departed.

""Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately. However well done to passenger with black t-shirt that intervened #hero.""

Ryanair told the BBC: ""We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this.

Eventually the woman is seen being moved, while other passengers implore the man to stop behaving aggressively. One passengers asks staff to remove the man from the flight.

Under article seven of Ryanair's terms and conditions, the airline may refuse carriage if a passenger's ""mental or physical state or attitude, behaviour or demeanour presents a hazard or risk to yourself, to passengers, to crew, or to property.""

Daughter's reaction

HuffPost has reported that the woman is a member of the Windrush generation and was returning from a holiday to mark the anniversary of her husband's death.

""I don't know how to go forward or where to take this. I'm not even sure what I want done to resolve the situation, beyond an open apology to my mother for the way that the things were handled.

""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief that she's already experiencing,"" Huff Post reported.

""As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with.""

""We will never fly with Ryanair again.""

Responses

On Twitter, Ryanair has asserted: ""We are aware of this video and have reported this matter to Essex Police. As this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.""

Ryanair told the BBC: ""We operate strict guidelines for disruptive passengers and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this.

""We will be taking this matter further and disruptive or abusive behaviour like this will result in passengers being banned from travel.""

Essex Police told i in a statement: ""This incident, which we were made aware of this morning, is believed to have taken place on a plane at Barcelona Airport.

""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation.""

A man who was filmed racially abusing an elderly woman on a Ryanair flight has been identified, police said.

Footage posted on social media appeared to show a plane passenger calling Delsie Gayle an ""ugly black bastard"" and telling her ""don't speak to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow"".

The incident is believed to have taken place on Ryanair flight FR015 at Barcelona Airport on October 19th, before it left for London Stansted.

Essex Police said on Tuesday: ""We have worked to identify both parties involved in this incident and passed the information to the Spanish authorities who are leading on this investigation.

""Our officers will continue to provide assistance where necessary throughout the course of this case.""

The woman who was subject to the abuse said she felt ""very low"" about the incident.

Speaking to ITV News, Mrs Gayle (77), from east London, said: ""I feel very low. He pays his fare, I pay mine. So why did he abuse me for that? Because of the colour of my skin.

""If I had done that to him, I'm sure they would have called the police.""

Ms Gayle said her experience has discouraged her from flying with the low-cost airline in future.

She continued: ""I feel really depressed about it. I go to bed and say: 'what have I done?' I haven't done anything to attack him, it's because of the colour of my skin I was abused like that.

""I decided I would not fly with that airline because they don't treat you with no respect.""

Her daughter, Carol, who was with her mother on the Barcelona flight, criticised Ryanair's response and claimed they have not yet received an apology from the airline.

She told ITV News: ""He should have been moved or taken off the plane and nothing was done.

""I know if that was a black person racially abusing an elderly woman the police would have been involved. It would have been a different matter.

Ryanair has slashed the prices of 1 million airline seats.

The sale, announced today, comes after the airline faced heavy criticism following the release of a video where staff failed to remove a man who appeared to shout racist abuse at another passenger.

The airline released a statement, saying it had reported the incident to Essex Police.

Ryanair sent out an email this morning to customers, advertising a flash sale where fares are slashed until midnight on Monday, for travel between November and March.

Footage of a white man hurling racist abuse at an elderly black woman seated next to him on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London Stansted quickly went viral after the incident on Friday.

The man was caught on camera loudly ordering the woman to move away from him and making racist comments about her appearance and accent.

He called the Jamaican-born woman a ""stupid, ugly cow"" and an ""ugly black bastard"", and told her not to speak to him in a ""foreign language"" even though she was speaking English.

Cabin crew appeared to go along with the man's demand that the woman be moved to another seat, rather than challenge his behaviour or remove him from the jet.

The Ryanair flight soon took off from Barcelona Airport, with the man apparently escaping any consequences.

The Irish airline tweeted on Sunday that it had reported the incident to Essex Police, but its handling of the episode is now the focus of intense criticism on social media.

Labour MP David Lammy tweeted: ""Ok boycott @Ryanair if they think it's ok for a racist man to abuse an elderly black woman and remain on the plane.

""It's 63 years since Rosa Parks said 'No' to sitting on the back of the Bus and we ain't going back.""

Fellow Labour MP Karl Turner wrote: ""@Ryanair have failed spectacularly here.

""Suspect the pressure to turn this aircraft around quickly and get it airborne meant that they have allowed this alleged offender to remain on the aircraft. He may now get away with it.""

Mr Turner added that because Ryanair is an Irish company and the incident occurred on the ground in Spain, the man most likely could not be prosecuted in Britain.

He slammed the airline for not alerting the Spanish authorities while the plane was still on the tarmac.

""@Ryanair have 'tolerated' criminal behaviour,"" Mr Turner claimed on Twitter. ""Police may now not be able to prosecute.""

The passenger who recorded footage of the incident, David Lawrence, posted the video to Facebook - where it has been viewed millions of times and covered in world-leading publications such as The New York Times.

The footage shows the woman's daughter defending her mother to the man before a member of cabin crew attempts to calm them down.

""Don't tell me what to do,"" he answered. ""If I tell her to get out, she gets out.""

The elderly woman, who has arthritis, eventually got up to sit with her daughter as the flight attendant told the man he would speak with his supervisor.

Theresa May's spokesman refused to comment explicitly on the incident as Essex Police are investigating.

""When people are travelling and going about their public life, no-one should be subjected to intimidation or any form of abuse,"" the spokesman said.

A video of the original outburst was posted online on Friday afternoon.

It showed a row break out as flight from Barcelona to Stansted prepared to take off.

The victim, 77-year-old Mrs Gayle, was defended by her daughter, who told a man sitting next to them that her mother was disabled.

He replied: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out"".

The unidentified man then called her an ""ugly f****** c***"" and threatened to ""push"" her to another seat unless she was moved.

In a statement, the Irish firm maintained its net profit estimate for its current financial year to March 2019 of EUR1.1-1.2 billion (USD 1.27-1.38 billion) -- down 12 per cent -- owing to two pan-European strikes that forced it to cancel hundreds of flights.

Ryanair said this forecast -- which it had cut earlier this month -- reflected ""higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs"" -- referring to EU legislation which mandates passenger compensation in cases of delays or flight cancellation.

""While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27 per cent, these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs,"" said CEO Michael O'Leary.

""Our traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of air traffic control disruptions on record, grew six per cent.""

Ancillary income -- including revenue from food, drink and in-flight sales -- grew 27 per cent to EUR1.3 billion over the six months to September period.

A substantial factor in this increase was the change in the baggage system at Ryanair, which now requires passengers to buy priority boarding for the right to take a small suitcase inside the cabin.

Overall, the company registered an eight percent rise in revenue to EUR4.79 billion, but only 75 per cent of Ryanair flights arrived on time in the first half, compared to 86 per cent a year earlier.

Ryanair said it suffered from eight days of strikes over the summer.

""We worked well to minimise disruptions to our customers by operating over 90 per cent of our schedules on each of these days,"" the firm said in its statement.

On Friday, Ryanair said it had reached agreements with more unions across Europe as it looked to avoid yet more strike action.

Ryanair pilots across Europe staged a 24-hour stoppage in September to further demands for better pay and conditions, causing chaos for tens of thousands of passengers.

In July, strikes by cockpit and cabin crew disrupted 600 flights in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, affecting 100,000 travellers. A major issue among staff based outside Ireland remains the firm's practice of using Irish legislation in employment contracts.

A Ryanair passenger who launched a racist verbal attack of an elderly female member of the public 'may get away with it' because the flight had not taken off.

The sickening footage was shared around social media showing a white man directing horrific abuse towards a black woman sitting one seat away from him.

Other passengers were left furious as he sat and unleashed the attack on the Stansted-bound flight, calling the woman a ""ugly black b*****d"" - as well as shouting ""don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow"".

As reported by the Mirror Online, the incident happened on October 19 on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to Stansted.

After the footage went viral online, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling came out and demanded police intervention over the incident, although Labour politician Karl Turner explained how the man may actually get away with it.

The reason is because the flight had not taken off and happened on Spanish soil, which means because Ryanair is an Irish company, British police may be powerless to act.

The East Hull MP wrote on Twitter : ""Suspect the pressure to turn this aircraft around quickly and get it airborne meant that they have allowed this alleged offender to remain on the aircraft.

""He may now get away with it.""

Turner, who is a qualified barrister, explained how the incident is not covered by UK law because it happened before the plane took off.

""@Ryanair failure to deplane the alleged racist offender, handing him over to the Spanish authorities probably means that he isn't now prosecuted.""

He added: 'Unfortunately because @Ryanair is registered in Dublin not in the UK the alleged offence could only be tried by UK authorities if it was ""in flight"" to the UK. Section 92(1) Civil Aviation Act s.92(4) defines 'in flight'.

""If this incident had have happened on an alternative airline under ""British Control"" or it was already ""in flight"" to the UK the prosecuting authorities could have prosecuted.""

105,[],"British police are investigating after footage of a man shouting racist abuse at an elderly black woman on a Ryanair flight went viral over the weekend, with the airline facing criticism over how it dealt with the incident.

The unidentified man insulted her after complaining that she had inconvenienced him as he tried to reach his seat aboard.

""Don't talk to me in a fucking foreign language you stupid ugly cow,"" the man tells the woman before a man in the row behind asks him to stop.

""I will carry on as long as I can with this ugly black bastard,"" he retorts.

Ryanair said that they were aware of the matter and had reported it to the police. The airline's chief financial officer declined to comment on the story.

""Essex Police takes prejudice-based crime seriously and we want all incidents to be reported. We are working closely with Ryanair and the Spanish authorities on the investigation,"" the police said in a statement.

The video was taken by another passenger while the plane was waiting to take off from Barcelona to London Stansted airport on Friday.

After the argument, the woman was eventually moved from her seat. A flight attendant appears to tell the man he will discuss the incident with his supervisor, but the passenger is left in his place.

""I've seen airlines ground to a halt, and police called, and passengers escorted off of planes for less,"" David Lawrence, who recorded the video, told BBC Radio.

The police investigation comes as the Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, announced on Monday a 7% fall in profits in the first six months of the year. Ryanair has been grappling with the impact of recent strikes, high fuel costs and intense competition.

Britain's interior minister resigned earlier this year over the treatment of some Caribbean ""Windrush"" migrants who were invited to Britain after World War Two but were left without documents and denied basic rights, a scandal that highlighted persistent racial inequalities in British society.

Lawrence added that the woman, who he is in touch with, was from the Windrush generation, and that the frequency of such racist abuse made people numb to it.

Then the man shouted at the woman while her daughter told him her mother was disabled.

Although a fellow passenger and a flight attendant tried to intervene and calm the man down, he replied that he would carry on as far as possible with ""this ugly black bastard"".

A number of passengers on the flight called for the man to be removed from the plane, but he was still allowed to stay on it, which sparked public outcry after the video was viewed for more than 4 million times on Facebook.

David Lawrence, the passenger who recorded the widespread video, told BBC on Sunday that he was ""shocked"" that Ryanair ""allowed something like this just to go unchecked"".

The man was filmed by a fellow passenger calling the elderly woman an 'ugly black b*****d', and shouting 'don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow'.

The footage was recorded on October 19 on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted by Kent resident David Lawrence who uploaded it on to social media.

It shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.

He replies: 'I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out.'

The man then tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: 'if you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat'.

Staff on the flight seemed to do little to silence the man during the footage, leaving a passenger in the row behind to try and deal with the situation.

The cabin crew can be heard to say: 'Don't be so rude, you have to calm down;' while other passengers call for the man to be thrown off the flight.

The victim can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash, before asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter.

The daughter of the woman who was targeted said she believed if a black person had behaved in the same way they would have been thrown off the flight immediately.

The woman, 53, told the Huffington Post the row had started because her 77-year-old mother's arthritis meant it took her some time to move out of the way so the man could reach the window seat.

The daughter said she had taken her mother, who is a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark one year since the death of her father.

The woman said that when she had complained to cabin crew they denied hearing any racial slurs and they told her to ring customer services on Monday.

Delsie Gayle, 77, fears the man responsible will 'get away with it' and also criticised the airline for failing to get in touch with her despite national outrage over the incident.

A passenger with a British accent was caught on camera shouting a string of abuse at Mrs Gayle on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London Stansted before take-off on Friday. The situation was diffused when she moved to another seat, but Ryanair staff were criticised for not removing the man.

Footage of the encounter has been viewed more than 7million times on social media and has prompted transport secretary Chris Grayling to call on police to take action.

Speaking to ITV News yesterday, Mrs Gayle fought back tears as she said: 'I feel really, really depressed about it. I go to bed and think ""what have I done?"" for someone to attack me for the colour of my skin.

'I don't know when I'm going to get over it, because every time I remember I cry, I don't eat, I can't sleep.' She added: '[If] he gets away with it, he'll do it to somebody else.'

The retired care assistant, who suffers from arthritis, had been taken on a three-day break by her daughter to lift her spirits one year on from the death of her husband of 50 years.

Her interview came as the passenger who filmed the viral video said he chose not to intervene because he wanted to show the world the experiences of Britain's West Indian community.

David Lawrence said it was a 'difficult decision' not to step in but he felt it was important to expose the incident in order to make the public aware what was happening to the black community.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'What if that was a role reversal and that was a black man abusing an elderly white woman? He would have been thrown off the flight, probably thrown into a Spanish jail.'

Ryanair said it could not comment because 'this is now a police matter'. Essex Police said it was working with the airline and Spanish authorities.

According to HuffPost UK, the woman was returning from a holiday organised by her daughter to cheer her up ahead of the first anniversary of her husband's death.

The video was recorded on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London Stansted on Friday.

After a row over seating involving the woman's daughter, who was sat in another part of the plane, the man in the window seat can be seen loudly shouting at the elderly woman in the aisle seat of the row.

Indicating the seat between them, he can be heard saying: ""I hope somebody sits there because I don't want to sit next to your ugly f****** face.""

After threatening to 'push' her to another seat, the woman replies quietly.

The incident, on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted on Friday, was recorded by a fellow passenger and shared on social media.

Many people said Ryanair should have removed the man from the flight and threatened to boycott the airline.

Ryanair said it ""will not tolerate unruly behaviour like this"".

It has referred the matter to Essex Police.

In the film - viewed on Facebook more than 1.8 million times - the man can be heard being racially abusive to the woman and threatening to ""push"" her to another seat.

He also shouts at her: ""Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow.""

After a flight attendant intervenes, the woman says she wants to sit with her daughter and tells the man he ""stinks"". She says of the passenger: ""Kick him out"".

Her daughter has told The Huffington Post the row started because her mother, 77, has arthritis and it took some time for her to move out of the way for the man to get into his seat.

David Lawrence, who filmed what happened, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Everything was calm, we were getting ready to take off. And then a man came on board and arrived at his seat, then spoke very harshly to a woman sitting in the aisle seat.

""That was what got my attention as it was very loud and very aggressive. He started to shout at the woman, saying 'get out of the way', 'move your feet', 'you shouldn't be sitting here'.""

Mr Lawrence said no attendants initially came over. The woman's daughter, who had been sitting elsewhere, arrived and ""an argument started"", he said.

""He pushed past the woman and went to his seat,"" he said, adding that what's seen in the video then unfolded - describing it as the ""most disgusting exchange of racial slurs and foul language"".

The woman's daughter said she had taken her mother, a Windrush Generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark a year since the death of her husband.

She told The Huffington Post: ""I know that if I was behaving like he was - or any other black person for that matter - police would have been called and we would have been kicked off the flight.""

She added: ""Mum's really feeling upset and very stressed about this situation, on top of the grief she's already experiencing. As for me, I'm upset about the whole thing too - the fact that the passenger wasn't taken off the plane and how the situation was dealt with.""

One young man, seated in the row behind the people filmed in the video, intervened by telling the man who was shouting to stop. He has been praised for his actions.

A Ryanair attendant says to the man: ""Don't be so rude, you have to calm down."" He then tells the older man he is going to refer the incident to his supervisor, to which the man replies: ""I'm alright.""

""I am so shocked,"" Mr Lawrence said. ""There was no response [from most other passengers]. No-one said anything. The young man who actually intervened... he was compelled to step forward.""

Mr Lawrence said it was a ""horrible, horrible situation"" and that he was ""shocked"" that Ryanair ""allowed something like this just to go unchecked"".

BBC presenter Jeremy Vine was among those saying the incident was ""beyond belief"", saying Ryanair ""need to explain how this man's disgusting racial abuse of the black lady in the seat next to him ends up with HER being asked to move"".

Shadow transport minister Karl Turner was among those to tweet about the incident, saying he would raise ""the tendency of airlines to ignore this kind of behaviour"".

He also said ""he should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police"".

Critics of the incident and how it was handled said the man should have been removed - rather than the woman herself moving seats.

The elderly woman who a fellow Ryanair passenger aimed racist comments at broke down in tears as she watched footage of the tirade.

Delsie Eunice Gayle, 77, was on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to Stansted, when a passenger was filmed calling her an ""ugly black b*****d"".

Ryanair was criticised for failing to remove the man, who Essex Police have since said they have identified.

Delsie appeared on This Morning today, and was filmed watching the horrific footage.

She says she has been left ""depressed and upset"" by the incident, which was filmed on Friday, October 19.

Low cost airline Ryanair launched a fire-sale on tickets on Monday, which has since ended.
